(Cut to Candace in her bed. Her alarm goes of going back and forth between saying, "BUSTIN' TIME!" and "6:00".)
Candace's alarm: (Phineas' voice, while beeping) I know what we're gonna do today! I know what we're gonna do today! I know what we're—
(Candace turns off the alarm.)
Phineas: (offscreen) I know what we're gonna do today!
Candace: (growls, gets out of bed, and shouts out the window) And I know what I'm gonna do today! Bust you guys once and for all! Do your worst or your best. Just make it big and bustable, so I can show Mom!
Phineas: Wow! That was awfully supportive. And you said Candace wasn't a morning person. (to Ferb)
Candace: (walking towards her bedroom door) This is it, Candace – the last day of summer vacation! Your last chance to bust the (steps on a rollerskate) boooo- (steps on a skateboard and rolls down the stairs) -ooooooo – ugh! (falls off the skateboard and lands in a wagon, starts rolling around the house) Uh! Why do we have this many (pauses as she rolls behind a wall) wheeled objects lying around the house?
Linda: (reading the newspaper at the kitchen table) Oooh! Looks like the zoo's got a new tiger habitat. (Lawrence playfully roars at Linda and Candace rolls into the kitchen.) Good morning, Candace.
Candace: (unenthusiastically) Uh-huh. (pauses) And so begins the last day of summer. (wagon is stopped by Perry's dish)
Linda: (getting up with her purse) Which means back to school errands for me and making the most of the day for you. (looking at her watch) Ooh! I better get a move on. Those errands aren't gonna run themselves. (chuckles) They never do! (unenthusiastically) They never do. (leaves)
(Cut to Phineas and the gang in the backyard)
Phineas: Well, today's a big day, so it's a good thing we're getting an early start!
Isabella: I don't wanna waste one minute of our last day of summer!
Baljeet: Yipeeeeee! Last day of summer means first day of schooool! Ha-ha ha! (realizes the disproving looks on everyone else) I mean boooooo...
Isabella: Seems like only yesterday I walked through that side gate and asked "Whatcha doin?" when you were building that rollercoaster for the first time.
Phineas: Since it's our last day of summer, we're thinking a grand finale is in order. Show 'em the blueprints, Ferb.
(Ferb pushes the button on a remote and a giant blueprint comes up out of the ground.)
Baljeet and Isabella: Oooooh!
Buford: Eh, could use a little somethin' more. (more blueprint rolls out above the first one) Dere it is, but where's Perry?
(Cut to the side of the house. Perry walks around the corner, looks back, then gets up on his hind legs. He then puts on his fedora, takes out a remote, pushes the button, and steps into a secret door in the side of the house. An elevator takes him down to his lair, where, on the screen, Major Monogram waits for him. Perry drops into his seat.)
♪ Doo bee doo bee doo bah ♪
♪ Doo bee doo bee doo bah ♪
Major Monogram: Oh, good, Agent P, you're here! You're probably wondering about all these pulley things here. (eyes directing to tassel-like pulleys on his left and right) It's just that, with Carl heading to school soon, I'm (pauses) gonna have to learn to run this place all by myself. (grips the pulleys) Anyway, (pulls his left one to make a crudely drawn picture of fall leaves roll down in front of him on the screen) with the seasons about to change, I suspect Doofenshmirtz (a crudely drawn picture of Doofenshmirtz rolls down) will be trying to close out the summer (a crudely drawn picture of a "bang" rolls down) with a bang. (all the pictures, with his right pulley, fall to the floor) Great googly moogly! Carl! (his left pulley, still being gripped by Monogram, comes detached and dangles from his left hand.) Oh, that's right: (sadly realizing Carl isn't there) school. (Agent P takes off in his rocket chair.) Keep it together, Francis.

Act II
(The scene opens to a view of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated)
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪
(Doofenshmirtz's alarm goes of and he sits up. In the process, he hits his head on a light hanging over his bed and falls back onto his pillow. At the same time, the alarm stops)
Doofenshmirtz: Ow! Okay, I've had enough of you! (to the light)
(He then shoots it with an handheld device that surrounds it with green energy and makes it vanish.)
Norm: (walking towards Doofenshmirtz's bed with a slice of chocolate cake) Wakey wakey, chocolate cakey! (takes a fork of it and points it at Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: (annoyed) How many times do I have to tell you that chocolate cake isn't for break— (Norm stuffs the bite in his mouth, Doofenshmirtz chews and swallows) I stand corrected. All right, up an' at 'em.
Norm: Sir, since when do you sleep in your lab coat?
(Doofenshmirtz looks at himself then looks at Norm angrily)
Doofenshmirtz: Since none o' your business!
(He runs out of his bedroom and Vanessa approaches him.)
Vanessa: Hey, (Doofenshmirtz stops and turns around) Dad, you have a minute?
Doofenshmirtz: Can it wait, sweetie? I've got a lot of stuff on my evil to-do list to do today. To do today. To-do to-day,
Vanessa: Dad.
Doofenshmirtz: ♪ to-do to-day, to-do to-day. ♪
Vanessa: Dad!
Doofenshmirtz: It's like a little song! (starts doing a little dance) ♪ To-do, ♪
Vanessa: (angrily) Dad!!
Doofenshmirtz: ♪ to-do, to-do to-day, to-do, ♪
Vanessa: (rolling her eyes) Ugh! (walks away)
Doofenshmirtz: ♪ to-do todaaay! ♪ All the ladies in the house say— (points where Vanessa was) Wait! Where'd she go?
(Cut to Phineas and the gang in their backyard)
Phineas: (referencing something that's offscreen) Great job, gang! Whadaya think?
(Their giant invention is revealed and a fanfare sounds)
Isabella: Sooo, what is it?
Phineas: It's everything!
Buford: Who says you can't have it all?
Baljeet: Yippee! For this and not for school. (walks away from the others and whispers) I love you school! (walks back)
Buford: (looks at Baljeet disapprovingly) Do other nerds erect statues to you?
Baljeet: (looks at Buford embarrassingly) Maybe.
Isabella: (referencing the invention) Looks pretty mega to me!
Buford: (walking over to Phineas and Ferb) Yeah, it's pretty mega, but is it really grand finale material worthy (hugs Phineas and Ferb) of these two guys? (pausing and realizing what he did) I just made it weird, didn't I?
Phineas: No, not at all!
Ferb: Hugs are a healthy expression of affection between friends.
Buford: (letting go of them and looking at Ferb) Okay, now you just made it weird.
Phineas: Anyway, we've gotta make sure we've outdone ourselves on this one.
Buford: And there's only one way to do it.
Phineas: You're right, Buford. Let's ride it! (everyone but Buford starts running towards the invention)
Buford: Actually I was gonna say focus group testing, (starts running to catch up to the others) but "ride it" works too.
(With everyone wearing their helmets, Ferb pulls a lever and they all get sucked up to the starting point on the invention via individual colored tubes.)

Candace: (walking outside) Aha! The boys did it again! Big, dangerous, bustable: prime for megabust! (lifting cell phone and dialing a number) I'm calling Mom right now!
Phineas: Say "Hi" for us!
(Cut to Linda loading groceries into her station wagon at the Super Food Stuff Mart while talking on her cell phone.)
Linda: I know, I know. I'm on my way.
Candace: (on the cell phone) I'll meet you up front! (hangs up, then calls again) Hehehehehehehe.
(Cut to the kids in the backyard coming to the ground with parachutes)
Phineas: So, whadya say, guys? Best ride ever?
Baljeet: (looking at papers in his hands) Well, empirically speaking, the test results show almost unanimous approval ratings!
Buford: (coming down beside Baljeet) I have notes.
Baljeet: Like I said: almost.
Phineas: (smiling) Well, you heard him, Ferb. Back to the drawing board!
(Their invention compresses and folds up into a drawing board.)
Baljeet: (staring at their invention, now a drawing board) Wow, that was impressive, and quite literal.
(Candace quickly opens the fence gate with her Mom next to her.)
Candace: Tada!
Phineas: (waving to them while standing next to Ferb, who's drawing on the drawing board) Hi, Mom! Hi, Candace!
Candace: But, but but!
Linda: (taking Candace to the side) Look Candace, most days I would humor you, but not today. I'm way too busy. Don't you have stuff of your own to do before school starts?
Candace: Yeah, bust the boys!
Linda: Candace?
Candace: De-de ge-de de-de-de-de daaahhhh... (sulkily) I guess I can return Vanessa's DVDs.
Linda: (walking away) There ya go, Hon. They're not gonna return themselves.
Candace: They never do.
(Cut to a view of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, where Perry arrives in his rocket chair, but is then trapped in midair inside the bass drum from Norm's drum set)
Doofenshmirtz: (approaching the drum set while looking at Perry) Ah, Perry the Platypus: snared in my trap. (Norm plays a rim shot on the drum set) Ha! Drum pun! (starts walking away from the drum set onto the balcony) I realized that all this time I was planning to become ruler of the Tri-State Area, never took into account the fact there is no actual position. I should have spent my time creating one. And, if I create it, no one will know about it. (hops up to sit on the rim of the balcony) I will run unoppo (falls off the balcony) whoooa! (catches himself with his hands and lifts his face back over the side) That was close. Then I'll easily win, and (lifts up his left hand into a fist) take over the Tri-State Area. With that in mind, (lets go with both hands) be- (holds them up in the air and starts falling) hooooooooo... (Perry is shocked, teeth clenched, eyes wide open. Then the elevator dings and Doofenshmirtz comes back in and approaches his Inator with his arms up again.) Behold: The Tri-Governor-inator! (a drum roll sounds, Perry rolls over Doofenshmirtz with the bass drum, and a cymbal crash sounds) Wow, an actual drum roll. (Perry hits the banister, one drum head and hoop falls off, and Perry leaps out.) Ay-ah! (the doorbell sounds as Perry leaps on Doofenshmirtz and starts fighting him)
Vanessa: (walking past them) Please, so over it. (she opens the door to let Candace in, smiling)
Candace: (waving while holding DVDs) Hey, Vanessa! Just came by here to return (realizing it's Candace, Perry lets Doofenshmirtz out of a headlock and hides) your DVDs. Sorry I had them so long, can't say I understand French cinema. I mean, why does that mime keep letting go of balloons?
Vanessa: I think it's (Perry finds a hiding spot) symbolic.
Candace: (handing Vanessa the DVDs) Well, anyway, how's it goin'?
Vanessa: (starts feeling uninterested and stops smiling) I've been better.
Candace: (still smiling and gesturing) Me too! You wouldn't believe (stops smiling, but still has her eyes wide open) the day I'm having so far! I mean really. Like I could go on. Like I could tell you all about it. I mean there's a lot that happened and there's—
Vanessa: Yooou wanna (starts smiling again) come in?
Candace: (starts smiling again and comes in while Vanessa closes the door behind her) Oh wow, ya, that'd be great!
Vanessa: I could use some downloading too. I'll go make us some tea. (starts walking away) B-R-B.
Candace: Awesome! (starts walking towards Doofenshmirtz, who is now standing and is brushing himself off) Oh, hi, Vanessa's dad! How's it goin'?
Doofenshmirtz: (turning around to talk to her) Have you seen my nemesis? He was just here a second ago. He's about (holds his hand at an approximate height of Perry) yay high and—ha. You know what? No matter. When the guy who's punching you suddenly loses interest mid-punch, it's time to take serious stock of your life. (turns around) H-ugh.
Candace: I can totally relate! (Doofenshmirtz starts walking away) Like from the beginning of today it was pretty bad. Like I'm all off.
Doofenshmirtz: (trying to find Perry) Uh-huh.
Candace: And you know every day this summer I've been trying to bust my brothers, and it's just not happening.
Doofenshmirtz: Uh-huh.
Candace: Do you know how frustrating it is to have a single unrealized focus in your life?
Doofenshmirtz: Well that's just crazy. Gotta be some kind of teenage thing. (starts walking back over to her after giving up on finding Perry)
Candace: Same old, same ol' yadda yadda ya bledolbledolbledolbledolbledolbledol. That's been my day so far. (starts lowering herself onto an Inator)
Doofenshmirtz: (runs to her and frantically waving Candace off the machine) Don't sit on that, a-and stop fussing with all of my Inators!
Candace: Inators? Why? What does this (points at the machine she almost sat on) one do?
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, that is my Do-Over-Inator.
Candace: What's a Do-Over-Inator?
Doofenshmirtz: Really? It says "do over" right in the name. I-it does the day over again, but I haven't worked out all the kinks yet. Matter of fact, I gotta work out the kinks in a lot o' these.
Candace: (looking at the machine) A Do-Over-inator? (presses the purple button second farthest to the left, causing the Inator to make loud mechanical noises and surround her and Doofenshmirtz with a large, glowing blue-purple bubble, then emit a blue flash)
(After we see a forever looping spiral clock, cut to Candace in her bed. Her alarm goes off going back and forth between saying, "BUSTIN' TIME!" and "6:00".)
Candace's alarm: (Phineas' voice, while beeping) I know what we're gonna do today! I know what we're—
(Candace turns off the alarm.)
Phineas: (offscreen) I know what we're gonna do today!
Candace: (growls, gets out of bed, and shouts out the window) And I know what I'm gonna do today! Bust you guys once and for all! Do your worst or your— you know, just make it (starts feeling the familiarity of the conversation) big and... bustable, so I can show... Mom.
Phineas: (outside offscreen) Wow! That was awfully supportive.
Candace: (walks away from the window) Talk about déjà v— (runs back to the window to talk to Phineas) You there, boy! What day is it?
Phineas: Why, the last day of summer, of course!
Candace: (enthusiastically) Aaah! Yes! Vanessa's dad's machine! It worked! Which means that yesterday is today! Another chance(steps on a rollerskate) to bust the boooo- (steps on a skateboard and rolls down the stairs) -ooys! I didn't think there would be this part!– ugh! (falls off the skateboard and loses the skate, lands in a wagon, and starts rolling around the house) Har... (pauses as she rolls behind a wall) dee har har.
Linda: (reading the newspaper at the kitchen table) Oooh! Looks like the zoo's got a new tiger habitat. (Lawrence playfully roars at Linda and Candace rolls into the kitchen.) Good morning, Candace.
Candace: (smiling) Mm-hmm! (pauses) And so begins the last day of summer! (wagon is stopped by Perry's dish and she pauses, then points at Perry) Again!
Linda and Candace: (Linda getting up with her purse) Which means back to school errands for me and making the most of the day for you.
Linda: (angrily) Hey!
Candace: (happily getting up out of the wagon and approaching Linda) Hey! This is amazing! (approaching and holding onto a chair) Today is exactly the same as yesterday! It's repeating! (leans her elbows on the chair back)
Lawrence: Very existential, darling. You're getting philosophical as you get older.
Candace: (walking away and pointing at Lawrence) And BUSTosophical!
Linda: (looking at Candace with lowered eyelids and speaking in a sing-song voice) That's not even a wo-ord!
Candace: (coming back) It is now! (walks around Linda and speaks in a sing-song voice) I made it u-up!
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz in his bed, where his alarm goes of and he sits up. In the process, he hits his head on a light hanging over his bed and falls back onto his pillow. At the same time, the alarm stops)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah! Taah... Didn't I disintegrate you? (to the light)
(He then shoots it with an handheld device that surrounds it with green energy and makes it vanish.)
Norm: (walking towards Doofenshmirtz's bed with a slice of chocolate cake) Wakey wakey, chocolate cakey! (takes a fork of it and points it at Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: (annoyed) Really? Didn't I tell you cake isn't for breakfast (knocks the cake out of Norm's hands and up and over the bed) yesterday? (realizes something) Hmm. (gets out of bed and runs out of his bedroom and Vanessa approaches him)
Vanessa: Hey Dad? (Doofenshmirtz turns around to see her)
Doofenshmirtz: (thinking) Hmm, repeating.
Vanessa: You have a minute?
Doofenshmirtz: M-hmm.
Vanessa: We really
Doofenshmirtz: M-hmm.
Vanessa: need to
Doofenshmirtz: M-hmm. (Vanessa growls and starts frowning) Yeah!
Vanessa: Dad!
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah! Everything is repeating! Th-that bang on my head, that-that thing with Norm and the stupid cake, a-and you! (starts walking to his Do-Over-Inator) I-it works! My Do-Over-Inator must work! Ah-your little friend must have (Vanessa catches up to him) activated it yesterday! A-and by "yesterday" I mean "today". Later today, your-uh little friend will activa– and the days will probably keep repeating until I shut it off!
Vanessa: (angrily) This is what I'm talking about. You're not even listening! (starts walking towards the door, without Doofenshmirtz noticing) I'm moving out, Dad. I'm going to live at Mom's... (walks out the door) full time. (slams the door)
Norm: (walking up to the door, still smiling) Door slams mean sadness.
Doofenshmirtz: (running over to Norm) Wait! What did she say?
(Norm presses his top button)
Norm's speaker: (Vanessa's voice) I'm going to live at Mom's... full time. (door slamming noise)
Doofenshmirtz: Aaah! I can't believe it! (inhales sharply) You surreptitiously record us? And even more importantly, I'm losing my little girl!

Act III
(Open to a view of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, then back to Doofenshmirtz and Norm)
Doofenshmirtz: Why would Vanessa want to move out?
Norm: Let's see if we can solve that little mystery! (presses his top button)
Norm's speaker: (Doofenshmirtz's voice) Hey, Vanessa, hand me that cadaver.
Norm: or (presses his button again)
Norm's speaker: (Doofenshmirtz's voice) Honeybun, if you go into the living room and see a pile of skin flakes, just ignore it.
Doofenshmirtz: Okay.
Norm: or (presses his button again)
Norm's speaker: (Doofenshmirtz's voice) I know you said the time machine in the bathroom was a bad idea, but if you need to go, you should do it last week.
Doofenshmirtz: Okay! Okay! I get it. I get it. My daughter's moving out because she thinks I'm a loser.
Norm: I like pancakes!
Doofenshmirtz: Buuuut, ya know who isn't a loser? The Tri-Governor! I just need to win that office and Vanessa will want to (starts walking towards his Do-Over-Inator) stay with me! And this (pets the Inator) little baby's gonna help me get it right.
(Norm starts playing the guitar)

(Cut to Phineas and Ferb with their friends in their backyard, right after the second part of the blueprint rolled down)
Buford: There it is, but where's Perry?
(Everyone turns their head to their right to see Candace walking towards them.)
Candace: Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Perfect! You guys built your sky-high mega-ride thingy. I just wanted to double-check, and this time, I'm not gonna call Mom. I'm gonna (starts walking backwards away from them) go get her. Ciao!
Phineas: (holding his hand up) Bye, Candace! (turns back towards his friends) Sky-high, huh? I think you're right, Buford. We can make this better, and Candace has just given me a great idea how to do it!
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz standing next to Norm with his drum set.)
Doofenshmirtz: (looking at his watch) Perry the Platypus should be coming in about three, two, one. (Perry comes in on his rocket chair and lands in the bass drum, then the bass drum is put in the drum set) Ha-ha! And, (Perry rolls towards Doofenshmirtz  in the drum and he hops out of the way) drum roll! (Perry rolls past him) Missed me! (Perry hits the staircase, flips over, then pops out of one of the drum's head and hoops.) And, skull! (a giant skull falls over Perry and traps him, then Doofenshmirtz walks over to him) It worked! It worked, and finally I get some use out of these old Halloween decorations. I'm the master of ti- (Perry opens the skull's mouth and clamps it down on Doofenshmirtz's body) ow! Oh, this really bites. (Perry breaks out of the top of the skull) Oh no, wait! Not my Inator! (Perry pushes the "X DESTRUCT" button on the Tri-Governor-inator and it blows up) That's okay, Perry the Platypus. I'll be the master of time tomorrow.
(Cut to Candace opening her fence gate with Linda next to her.)
Candace: Tada! (realizing their backyard is empty) Huh? But-but, but?
Linda: (taking Candace off to the side) Look, Candace. Most days, I would humor you, but not today. I'm way too busy—
Candace: I know, you're way too busy getting us ready for school, so I'll just take care of the stuff I have to do before tomorrow.
Linda: (walking away) Couldn't have said it better myself.
Candace: Well, no one can say I didn't try, twice. (walks to the house)
(Phineas and Ferb's invention is revealed floating above the yard, and the kids parachute down)
Phineas: Ah, it's a shame Candace missed out on the fun. She did give us the cool idea to levitate it, after all.
(the swirly clock appears again, then we cut to Candace in her bed. Her alarm goes off going back and forth between saying, "BUSTIN' TIME!" and "6:00".)
Candace's alarm: (Phineas' voice, while beeping) I know what we're gonna do today! I know what we're—
(Candace turns off the alarm.)
Phineas: (offscreen) I know what we're gonna do today!
Candace: (quickly and happily sitting up) No way! (sticks her head out the window and yells to Phineas) You there, boy! What day is it?... again.
Phineas: Why, the last day of summer, of course!
Candace: (screams happily and ducks her head back into the house) Yes! The days are repeating! Which means, I still have a chance to— (notices her skates on the floor and starts talking to it) Oh, no. I'm not falling for that one again. (walks to the side) Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me, but fool me three times and (steps on a third skate) whooooa! Why do I even have (steps on the skateboard) three skates? (falls off the skateboard)
Lawrence: (reading a newspaper at the kitchen table) Oooh.
Candace: (rolling past the table in the wagon and speaking unenthusiastically) There's tigers at the zoo. Roar.
Linda: (reading a newspaper next to Lawrence) And so we begin another day.
Candace: (getting Linda out of her chair) Yes,-and-you've-got-errands-to-run-'cause-they're-not-gonna-run-themselves.-They-never-do.-They-never-do.(starts pushing Linda out of the house) Better-get-a-move-on-if-you're-gonna-be-back-in-an-hour-and-twenty-seven-minutes.-Bye!
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz in his bed with his alarm going off.)
Doofenshmirtz: (sitting up, stopping before he hits the lamp) Ah! (moves around the lamp and points at it) Ah! Ha-a! (gets out of bed) Ha-ha!
Norm: (standing at the foot of the bed) Wakey, wakey—
Doofenshmirtz: (passing him and leaving the bedroom) Stuff it, Norm!
(Norm stuffs the cake in his face, and it comes out of his ears in a manner similar to what would happen if you stuffed clay in a modern Mr. Potato Head, minus body parts actually falling off.)
Vanessa: (approaching Doofenshmirtz outside his room) Dad, (Doofenshmirtz turns around) do you have a minute? It's really—
Doofenshmirtz: (holding a clipboard with drawings of Perry the Platypus and traps and with an "I can handle anything" look on his face) Hush (holds his hand up and puts both hands on her shoulders) I know.
Vanessa: Dad, I—
Doofenshmirtz: (holding a finger over Vanessa's mouth) Sh, sh, sh. (lowers finger and smiles) I know exactly what you're going to say and I'm on it, but right now, I need to (looks at the clip board and points at it with a pencil) study Perry the Platypus's every move.
Vanessa: (angrily) Dad, this is the problem! (Doofenshmirtz writes on the clipboard) Because of your stupid work—
Doofenshmirtz: Hold that thought, sweetie. I've really gotta go and improve Perry the Platypus's trap. (starts walking away) B-R-B! (stretches back) That's uh, that's "be right back". It's hip today to talk in acronyms. (walks away again)
(Cut to a slightly later time. The giant skull lands on Perry, he breaks out, and a wood beam with a bowl on it swings around, catches Perry, and throws him into a metal cage.)
Doofenshmirtz: (rolling up to Perry while in a hamster ball) Ah-hu, hah! I can see by the confused and somewhat annoyed look on your face that your little mammal brain is working overtime trying to figure out how I anticipated your every move, not to mention the purpose of this... hamster ball. Well, it's simple! You see, this protects me from when you eventually escape from that! (notices Perry has escaped) Like, like that, but you can't punch, kick, or otherwise bruise me, because I'm safe inside of (Perry punches the ball and Doofenshmirtz starts rolling around the room) thii-oooo
Norm: (with a pan of muffins)It's muffin time, sir!
Doofenshmirtz: (rolling past him) Later! (A blue portal opens and the muffins get sucked into it) Oh, whooa... (bounces off the balcony) Maybe I'll get lucky and time will loop before (crashing noise) Oh! No sudden—
(Time loops, and then we cut to Candace in her bed. Her alarm goes off going back and forth between saying, "BUSTIN' TIME!" and "6:00".)
Candace's alarm: (Phineas' voice, while beeping) I know what we're gonna do toda—
(Candace turns off the alarm.)
Candace: (smirking) Alarm,
Phineas: (offscreen) I know what we're gonna do today!
Candace: kids in the backyard, (quickly sitting up) I'm back, baby! (slides down the banister) Yihoo! (lands on the floor and runs past the kitchen table) Tigers at the zoo! Roar-r-roar-roar-roar! Mom, gotta go: errands. (pulls Linda out of her chair) Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! (while pulling her out of the house)
Lawrence: (looking back at his newspaper) Well, she's having a good day.
(Another blue portal appears and sucks up Lawrence's spoon out of his cereal. Lawrence proceeds to lap at his cereal like a dog. We then cut to Candace walking outside right after the blueprints roll down)
Buford: There it is.
Candace: This is great. This time I'm gonna bust you outta this world!
Phineas: Hmm. Candace has just given me a great idea on how to make this thing even better!
(Song: "Quirky Worky Song")
(Flip to later that day, with the kids in space helmets and aluminum foil hose draped various places around the yard)
Candace: (walking towards them) Now it's all sci-fi?
Phineas: You inspired it, Candace. It's out of this world!
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, where Perry is thrown into a dinosaur-like, maraca holding robot, then breaks out through the belly, and it falls apart. He then throws the maraca from its left hand at Doofenshmirtz, and it hits him in the face.)
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb's backyard, where alien spaceships carry off their invention right before Candace pushes Linda through the gate in a shopping cart.)
(Time loops, and then we cut to Candace's alarm going off going back and forth between saying, "BUSTIN' TIME!" and "6:00".)
Candace's alarm: (Phineas' voice, while beeping) I kno—
(Candace turns off the alarm.)
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, where Perry narrowly ducks under being caught in a bear trap. It falls over, and Perry throws it over Doofenshmirtz's neck.)
(Cut to Candace carrying Linda through their fence gate on her shoulders.)
Candace: (noticing the kids in the backyard with no invention) But, but, but.
(Time loops, and we cut to Candace's alarm going off going back and forth between saying, "BUSTIN' TIME!" and "6:00".)
Candace's alarm: (Phineas' voice, while beeping) I know what we're gonna do today!
(Cut to Perry being thrown into a cage hanging on a chain. It swings back and hits Doofenshmirtz in the face, making him fall over.)
(Cut to Candace sliding through the backyard gate on her knees while holding Linda.)
Candace: (noticing the empty backyard) But, but, but.
(Time loops, and we cut to Candace's alarm going off going back and forth between saying, "BUSTIN' TIME!" and "6:00".)
Candace's alarm: (Phineas' voice, while beeping) I know what we're gonna do today!
(Cut to Perry landing with his legs being caught in springs. Doofenshmirtz points and laughs right before Perry jumps on his face with the springs attached to a floor tile.)
(Cut to Candace showing Linda through the fence gate while dressed as a clown. Only the kids are there.)
(Cut to Perry being thrown into a trap with the trap's arm. Doofenshmirtz leans on it, but Perry escapes by pushing the arm off, and uses it to whack Doofenshmirtz in the back of the head.)
(Cut to Candace rolling a sumo wrestler costume-wearing Linda through the gate to the backyard. Just the kids are there, so Candace angrily rolls Linda out.)
(Time loops, and we cut to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, where Doofenshmirtz has set up an extremely large scheme of traps for Perry the Platypus, and Norm is holding a box of to the side.)
(End of "Quirky Worky Song")
Doofenshmirtz: (pouring oil on the floor) Okay, twenty-third time's the charm.
I totally got it all covered now. (walks over to Norm) Hand me that box of angry weasels, would ya, Norm? (Norm hands it to him and Doofenshmirtz opens it, then the weasels attack him) Ow! Ow! Ow! O-ow! (closes the weasels back in their box, and reveals his face, covered with injuries) Yes, they'll do. It's the latest Perry the Platypus trap.
Norm: De-lightful!
Doofenshmirtz: (here Perry's bass drum roll) And here he is. Norm, hand out the victory muffins.
Norm: What is a muffin?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, come on. You know. Like:
(Song: "The Muffin Man")
♪ Oh, do you know the muffin man, ♪
♪ That lives on Drury Lane? ♪
Drury Lane. Why would anyone buy a house on Drury Lane? It just sounds so, it sounds dreary, even though it's not actually "Dreary", it's "Drury".
Norm: Though entertaining, your muffin song did not stir my memory banks, sir.
Doofenshmirtz: Hmm, that's peculiar. I suppose it could be some type of anomaly caused by messing with the space time continuum. Might even be dangerous. Oh well, I'll have to... ignore that in my payroll, because (shows Perry still fighting through the series of traps) now that I've gotten a full thirty steps ahead of Perry the Platypus, I'm free to take over the Tri-State Ar— Vanessa, where are you going? (walks over to Vanessa) Don't you wanna talk?
Vanessa: Actually, I really do, but you seem busy.
Doofenshmirtz: (putting an arm around her) Oh, Honey, that's (smiles and points at her) very perceptive of you! (a slapping noise is heard and Doofenshmirtz turns his head) Yes! (turns back toward Vanessa) So, let's just put a pin in this. I'm kind of racing against the clock here. I know it seems like I'm putting you second, but it's only so I can put you first eventually!
Vanessa: Whatever, Dad. (walks away)
Doofenshmirtz: Vaness— ugh. Well, you'll see. This is going to be my moment to take over the Tri-State Area and then that will prove to you I'm not as big a loser as you think I am. (walks towards his Tri-Governor-inator on the balcony) Okay, no pressure. Tri-State governor's mansion, here I come! (pulls a lever on the Inator that activates it and makes it shoot out a purple beam that creates a mansion on top of City Hall) Sa-weet! Now I've just gotta get someone to vote for me— anyone, actually, 'cause I'm running unopposed. (comes out of his building in cardboard that says "VOTE FOR DOOF", and a voting booth that says "DOOF", "VOTE HERE", "VOTE EARLY", and "VOTE OFTEN") Voting today!
Man: I didn't know there were elections today.
Doofenshmirtz: (pushing him in the booth) Oh, get in the booth and do your civic duty.
Candace: I am so gonna get it right today! (runs past the kitchen table) I can feel it in my— (notices Lawrence and Linda eating cereal by dumping it into their mouth or eating it with their hands and comes back to the table) Um, ever hear of a spoon?
Lawrence: Spoon? Mm, no, can't say I have.
Candace: Ha-ha, ha! Hey! I hear there's a new tiger habitat, dahling.
Lawrence: Tiger? (stifles a laugh) That's a funny sounding word.
Linda: (standing up) Oh, these teenagers and their slang. (walking towards the open garage door and Candace notices something about her) I'd better go run my errands. They're not gonna run themselves. (turns around and grabs her purse, revealing she's wearing cargo shorts)
Candace: Mom? What happened to your Capri pants?
Linda: Capri pants? Now I think you're just messing with us.
Candace: Ha... No spoons? No tigers? No Capris? Uh-oh, something's really going wrong!
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz opening a door in his apartment)
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa? Vanessa! (runs to her) I need to talk to you about your, you know, wanting to move out.
Vanessa: Wait, you know about that? How—
Doofenshmirtz: (grasping her by the shoulders) Honeey, just watch! (turns on the television to DANVILLE 7, where Roger is speaking live from in front of City Hall)
Roger: (on the screen) Apparently, for the first time in Tri-State history, a Tri-Governor has been elected, and the voters have chosen, (looks down at his paper in shock) my brother, Heinz Doofenshmirtz?!
Doofenshmirtz: Yes! See, Vanessa? I'm not a loser anymore. Now you'll want to live with me at the Tri-Governor's mansion, right? Right?
Vanessa: Dad! It's not that—
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, wait, wait, ho-hold that thought, sweetie-peeps. A-as long as my Do-Over-Inator is on, this day could start all over again. I could lose it all. So, so, you know. (holds her hands) Go 'head and start packing your stuff. I'm just gonna run over and turn off my Inator. We're, we're movin' on up, Kiddo! (runs over to his Inator just as it is getting sucked into another blue portal as he grabs at it) Hey! Well, uh, I didn't see that coming, but it's gone, so I guess that's the end of the looping! And now, (flips to Doofenshmirtz on the balcony of the Tri-Governor's mansion with his left arm around an unimpressed and slightly annoyed Vanessa) everything's gonna be hunky-dory, 'cause I'm in charge, baby!
(Cut to Candace running up to Phineas and Ferb in their backyard)
Candace: Guys! Guys! I really need your help! There's this really weird thing that's happening! Days keep repeating because of a machine thingy that Vanessa's dad made, and there was this wagon, and now things are disappearing, like tigers, and spoons, and—
Phineas: What's a... "spoon"?
Ferb: What's a "tiger"?
Candace: See? That's my point! Stuff's disappearing! and once it goes, nobody remembers it— (Phineas and Ferb get sucked up into another portal) e-ever existed... (inhales sharply) Moooooo- (runs inside to Linda, who is vacuuming the living room) -om! It took them! (hangs on Linda) Like the spoons! (inhales) Mom, Phineas and Ferb are gone!
Linda: I'm sure it's going to be all right, dear, but, who are "Phineas" and "Ferb"?
(Dramatic sting.)

Act IV
(Open on the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Candace: How can you not know who Phineas and Ferb are?!
Linda: Lemme guess. They're your new favorite boy band?
Candace: No, Mom. Y'see, later on today, which is kinda like last month to me, Vanessa's dad invents this thing which he says doesn't work but it actually does, because, well, here I am.  But it also doesn't work because they're not here, so even though every day repeats, not everyone or everything repeats, because you don't even know what Capri pants are!!
Linda: "Capri Pants"? Is that a boy band?
Candace: They're— (slaps herself) Gah!
(Cut to the Tri-Governor Mansion.)
Doofenshmirtz: Check out your First Daughter suite! Not too keen to move out now, are ya?
Vanessa: Yeah. Very, very nice, Dad. But, listen, I have something I—
Melanie: Pardon me, sir, I hate to interrupt, but your schedule is jam packed today. (She takes Doof's hand and leads him out.)
Doofenshmirtz: Sorry, sweetie, but apparently, there's a lot of stuff I have to attend to. Look on the bright side, you can brag about your dad to your friends until I get back.
(Cut to a rather colorless place, which will heretofore be referred to as Nullville. Phineas and Ferb are walking around.)
Phineas: This is so weird. It's Danville...but it's not. Oh my gosh, Ferb! Spoons! Now I totally remember how we forgot about them when they disappeared! Which means we must have disappeared.
(An anomaly opens up and oranges fall from the sky.)
Phineas: Orange you glad we have somethin' to eat? (no response) You're right. You're right. We gotta figure out a way outta here. (A tiger roars offscreen.) Hope whatever that is likes oranges.
Ferb: Or at least orange-related puns.
(Cut to Isabella's house. Candace runs up to it.)
Buford: (offscreen) But I'm tellin' ya, the sun's rays'll make ya crazy.
(Cut to Isabella's backyard where Baljeet is measuring something with a device and Isabella is arguing with Buford.)
Isabella: I'm not gonna buy your hat, Buford.
Candace: Great! You're all together! Look, I need you guys to help me find my brothers!
Buford: And you are?
Isabella: She's my neighbor from across the street. But I thought you were an only child.
Candace: No, no, I have two little brothers and all of you are best friends! But then Vanessa's dad built this machine, and now the days are repeating and things like spoons and little boys like my brothers are starting to disappear. And the worst thing is nobody remembers them!
Buford: You should stay out of the sun!
(Cut to:)
♪ Doofenshmirtz Tri-Governor's Mansion! ♪
(Cut to Doof's oval office.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, Doofy-boy, time to govern-inate! (Perry enters the room on his jetpack.) Right on time, Perry the Platypus! (reading a piece of paper) This concerns you. I have just made it illegal to thwart the Tri-Governor of the Tri-State Area, which, ipso facto, is me. (Gives Perry the paper.) Go ahead, read it. It's all perfectly legal. Looks like your thwarting days are over, Perry the Platypus. (sighs) Y'know, I-I-I really miss our good old thwarting days already. I-In fact, your presence here is making me far too sad and nostalgic. So maybe you better go. (Perry leaves dragging his jetpack across the rug.) Just leave the way you came in. I'll bill ya for the carpet.
Perry: (chatters sadly)
Doofenshmirtz: No, no, don't give me the puppy dog eyes. You're gonna make me cry. Sheesh. (Perry jumps out the window.)
Melanie: (on speaker) Pardon me, Mr. Tri-Governor, the Mayor's on the line.
Doofenshmirtz: Put 'im through. Helloooooooooo, Roger!
Roger: (on speaker) Heinz, did you steal my secretary?
Doofenshmirtz: Yes. Yes I did.
Roger: (on speaker) What makes you think you can do a thing like that?!
Doofenshmirtz: Well, it's easy! (opens the floor revealing Roger at his desk looking up) Because I'm the boss of you! Nyah! (Closes the floor.) Ahh, this has already been a very productive day. (Melanie walks in with a huge stack of papers.) H-Hey, what's all this?
Melanie: More legislation that requires your signature, sir. (she leaves)
Doofenshmirtz: But I hate homework! I'd rather just play with this snowglobe. (Another anomaly appears and sucks the snowglobe out of his hand.) Oooh, oh! Oh, man, this is serious! I thought for sure my machine would've turned itself off when it disappeared, but it's still creating rifts in the space-time continuum! (pushes intercom) Melanie, bring me another snowglobe.
Melanie: (on speaker) Um, what's a snowglobe?
Doofenshmirtz: (gasps dramatically)
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb in Nullville collecting all the Capri pants and spoons and putting them in a pile.)
Phineas: Wow, this stuff is pretty random. I hope no one at home is planning to baste a turkey while wearing suspenders and Capri pants. (no response) You're right. Mr. Keene is having a very bad day!
(A couple of tigers appear in the distance.)
Phineas: And so are we!
(A time rift appears and snowglobes fall from the sky.)
Phineas: Run, Ferb! It's raining snowglobes! A-And the tigers, they are also a reason to run!
(Cut back to Isabella's backyard.)
Candace: No, I really do have two brothers and you guys are really best friends. I can't believe you don't remember!
Isabella: That's impossible! Right, Baljeet?
Baljeet: Huh? Oh, sorry. I am too preoccupied with today's wild fluctuations in the space-time continuum. With pressure readings like this, I could potentially get sucked into a rift. And then none of you would remember I ever existed!
Candace: Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
(Cut to Perry on a windowsill.)
Major Monogram: (on watch) Sorry, Agent P, I've received confirmation that Doof's anti-thwarting legislation is completely legal and official. So I guess we're the bad guys now. And I guess this means you're on hiatus at least until his term is over. Monogram out.
Perry: (chatters and sighs)
Vanessa: (on another windowsill) Perry? What are you doing here? (Perry joins her) Problems with my dad, too? Welcome to the club. (sighs) I've been trying all day to tell him that I've been accepted by OWCA's internship program, but that I can't join if I'm living with OWCA's public enemy number one. (Perry holds up three fingers.) Okay. Number three. Well, I'm just gonna have to tell him and try to convince him to see things my way. Thanks for the chat, Perry. Wish me luck! (She goes inside and Perry waves at her.)
(Cut to Isabella's backyard where Baljeet is showing the others a formula on an easel. Candace is intrigued, but Buford and Isabella are bored out of their minds.)
Baljeet: ...and at the destabilization point, the vortex collapses in on itself, and it becomes an actual "hole" in space-time, sucking the nearest person or object into it and they are lost in the void.
Buford: OH, PLEASE STOP TALKING!!!
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb trying to avoid the tigers.)
Phineas: Okay, tigers aren't much more than big house cats, right? So what have we got that will distract cats?
(Ferb takes some suspenders, Phineas takes some Capri pants, and they roll them up into a giant ball.)
Phineas: We don't have a ball of yarn, but we do have a big bouncy ball of Capri pants!
(Phineas throws the ball toward the tigers and it latches onto a lamppost. The tigers run up to it and play with it.)
Phineas: That'll hold 'em for a while. Come on, Ferb! We gotta figure out a way back home.
(Cut to the First Daughter's suite.)
Doofenshmirtz: Sweetie pie, I'm back! Sorry it took me so long. Who would've thought being Tri-Governor would be so involved?
Vanessa: Dad, I got an internship at OWCA, so I have to move out.
Doofenshmirtz: What?! But that's the opposite of what I— They're the good guys! I thought for sure now that when I was Tri-State Governor that we'd be okay!
Vanessa: Dad, you're totally missing the point. You spend all of your time working on your ridiculous inators and I can't—
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, first of all, they're not ridiculous. Convoluted and ultimately pointless, maybe.
Vanessa: Oh, come on, Dad, you build them just to exact petty revenge trying to prove you're evil.
Doofenshmirtz: What? I'm evil. I-I am evil!
Vanessa: No, Dad. You're basically a nice guy who's pretending to be evil. And, you know, it seems like it's all out of obligation to your backstories, not something that truly comes from your heart.
Doofenshmirtz: Wow. So, it, it's... It's really not about all the success-loser thing?
Vanessa: Dad, look, this OWCA internship is something I really wanna do. And I don't think this lifestyle choice is making you happy either. Is it?
(Beat.)
Doofenshmirtz: Wow again.
Vanessa: Look, all I'm saying is try something different.
Doofenshmirtz: Like a...Like a new inator?
Vanessa: No, like try to be a good guy.
Doofenshmirtz: A good guy? Me? I can be... Well, I guess I could. I-I could be a do-gooder, doing good, just for the sake of... doing good, or, er, what exactly do good guys do?
Vanessa: Well, they—
Doofenshmirtz: Eh, it doesn't matter. Anyway, I get it. I understand now.  There's just one thing I gotta do before the whole thing starts over ag—
(Clock transition.)
(Cut to Candace back in her bed.)
Candace's alarm: —know what we're gonna—
(She shuts it off.)
Candace: Ah. (gets up) Oh, man! I gotta start all over again!
(Cut to Doof back in his bed.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, man! I looped too soon, and I didn't have time to be good! (He disintegrates his lamp again.)
Norm: Wakey wakey!
Doofenshmirtz: Norm, stuff your cake!
Norm: Stuffing it, sir! (He puts the cake on his face.)
Vanessa: Hey, Dad, do you have a minute?
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa! Yes, yes, I know, you, you'd like to move in with your mother and you want to intern at OWCA and my being evil creates a conflict.
Vanessa: Um, yeah. How did you know—
Doofenshmirtz: Let's just leave it at I know and I vow to be good from now on so your worries are over.
Vanessa: Wow, you're kind of freaking me out.
Doofenshmirtz: Yes, yes, I'd be obnoxious if I wasn't so charming. Anyway, I have one more inator to complete and I've got to do it fast, so I could really use your help.
Vanessa: What's the inator?
Doofenshmirtz: The Time-Straighten-Out-inator! It straightens out time and keeps it from looping.
Vanessa: I think I'm looping.
Doofenshmirtz: Exactly!
(Cut to Baljeet's house. Baljeet appears in his bathrobe yawning and getting the doorbell.)
Baljeet: I am coming!
(Baljeet opens the door to reveal a very sleepy Buford and Isabella and an alert Candace, all in their pjs.)
Candace: Morning, Baljeet. Got to get an early start today. You kids chat, I'll get the thingy.
Baljeet: Um, who is that girl in the bathrobe?
Buford: I was so asleep.
Isabella: She made us come over here.
Baljeet: Yes, but who is she?
(Candace gets the time-space continuum reader.)
Candace: Got it! (to Baljeet) Here, Dr. Genius Boy! Take this and check out the space-time continuum.
Baljeet: (takes the device) I do not know what that will prove. The space-time continuum is remarkably stable, and—Oh, my goodness!
Candace: Blah blah blah blah blah, you could disappear forever and so could every memory of your existence. So here's the part you need to pay attention to! Are you listening?
Baljeet: I am totally listening!
Buford: I am so not listenin'.
Isabella: Me neither.
Candace: I have two brothers and you guys are all best friends. But now they're gone and nobody remembers them because of the space-time continuum thingy. Now, this is the part of the conversation where you tell me how you're gonna get my brothers back.
Baljeet: Well, they must have disappeared through a temporal rift. If we could calculate the location of the next rift, we could just throw in a rope with a life preserver tied to the end of it and pull it out.
Candace: Oh, really? A little donut-shaped pool toy is gonna save the universe?
Buford: (eating a donut) Ya had me at "donuts", lost me with everything else.
(Cut back to Doof's lab.)
Vanessa: So what you're saying is the days are repeating and you're the only one that notices.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, maybe that little friend of yours, too, 'cause she was inside the bubble.
Vanessa: What?
Doofenshmirtz: Not important. Check it out. Perry the Platypus should be coming in three, two, one.
♪ Perry! ♪
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus! (Perry unbuckles himself) That's right, take it in, Perry the Platypus. No traps. And, no, telling you that there are no traps is not part of a trap. Though that would have been genius. Oh, I missed that one. I'm actually not doing any evil today! Seriously. I promise. (Perry looks at him with his arms crossed.) So, whadaya say, how 'bout lending an old nemesis a hand, huh, Perry the Platypus? (Perry just looks at Doof and holds out his arms.) Your eyes say, "No!" but your hands say, "Yes!"
(Cut to Baljeet operating his laptop in the Flynn-Fletcher backyard.)
Baljeet: Isabella, what is the resonance reading on the top meter?
Isabella: Forty-two point one six!
Baljeet: Candace, what is the cosine of eighty-one point seven?
Candace: (using a calculator) Lessee. Seventeen.
Baljeet: Buford, did the light just change from green to red?
(Buford is sitting at a machine and the light changes from green to red.)
Buford: Why should I tell you?
Baljeet: Okay. (Baljeet makes some calculations.) Right... (pointing on a map) There! In fifteen seconds, that is the point of maximum disturbance! So it should be appearing right over...there! (A groundhog gets sucked into the rift.)
Candace: Wow. Crazy how it sucked up that groundhog, huh?
Buford: The what?
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb making some calculations of their own.)
Phineas: If things from Danville pass into this dimension when a rift opens, maybe the door swings both ways. If we can calculate the rift openings, then we can get back to our Danville. Heads up, Ferb! Incoming!
(Several rifts appear and groundhogs pour out of them.)
Phineas: Huh. Groundhogs.
Ferb: I hope that doesn't mean six more weeks of "Nullville".
Phineas: Ahhhhh!
(Cut to Candace and the gang in Danville Park holding a life saver on a rope.)
Candace: Talk to me, Baljeet!
Baljeet: By my new calculations, the next rift should appear right over...there!
(A rift appears.)
Isabella: Quick! Throw the life preserver!
(Candace does so.)
Candace: Phineas! Ferb! If you can hear me, grab the life preserver and we'll pull you back!
Buford: What's a "life preserver"?
Isabella: I have no idea.
Candace: You guys are just gonna have to trust me on this!
(They rope gets pulled by the rift and the gang gets sucked in.)
All: Whoooooooa!!!!

Act V
(Open on Doof's lab where Vanessa and Perry are building the inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: Who'd have though we'd be such a good team? My daughter, my nemesis, and my hot beverage. (Takes a sip.) Hmm. Counter-clockwise on that jib bolt, Perry the Platypus. Okay, stop. Perfect, it's done. The days won't loop anymore and I'll have my daughter back! My life will be on a new path and the world will be saved thanks to brand new good guy, Heinz Doofen—
(Clock transition.)
(Cut to Doof back in his bed.)
Doofenshmirtz: Aw, shmirtz! I was so close! (He tears the lamp from the ceiling.)
Norm: Wakey wakey!
Doofenshmirtz: (throws the lamp at Norm and it lands on Norm's head) Eat it yourself, Norm, I gotta get Vanessa, we gotta do everything faster!
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb in Nullville making calculations. A time rift opens and the life preserver drops down followed by Candace and the gang.)
Phineas: Hi, guys! So good to see you!
Isabella: (gasps)
(The dramatic kissing music from "Act Your Age" plays as Isabella sees Phineas.)

Isabella: (lovelorn) Phineas! (normally) Hey, Phineas.
Baljeet: (gasps) Spoon!
(Flashback Montage: Various scenes of Baljeet using a spoon.)
Baljeet: Oh, how I have missed spoons!
Buford: Orange! (dramatic music; suddenly winds down) Eh...not really gettin' a big rush of emotions over this.
Candace: And here are the Capri pants.
Isabella: How can you tell they're Capri pants? Maybe they're just regular pants for someone with shorter legs.
Candace: (throws the pants away) The important thing is—
Buford: (offscreen) Hey!
Candace: —my brothers are here and they're safe! (She runs up to them and hugs them.) I'm so glad you guys are all right!
Phineas: Thanks, Candace! It's great to see you, too!
Candace: Wow, I guess now that we're gone, too, Mom and Dad don't even remember having children. Their lives must be so empty.
(Cut to the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
(Song: Platypus Walk)
♪ Walk the Platypus Walk ♪
(Cut to the living room where Linda is dressed as a Vegas showgirl and Lawrence is dressed like a pimp and they are dancing around.)
(Cut back to Nullville.)
Isabella: Everything here is so gray and lifeless.
Baljeet: This place must exist outside the flow of time. Candace, you were the only one of us outside the loop. Were the looping intervals decreasing in chronological amplitude?
Candace: No, they were, um... Wait, what does that mean exactly?
Baljeet: Were the days getting shorter?
Candace: Yes, the days kept getting shorter and shorter.
Baljeet: (shudders) The time pocket is dissolving!
Buford: And where does that rate on the... "good-bad" scale?
Baljeet: Buford, when the time pocket ceases to exist, so will we!
(Dramatic closeups on Buford, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella. Zoom out on Isabella revealing she's wearing a pair of Capri pants.)
Isabella: See what I mean? One woman's Capri pants is another's... What'd I miss?
(The rest of the gang simply stare in blank space.)
(Cut to Doof's lab.)
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa!
Vanessa: Dad, I have to talk to you—
Doofenshmirtz: Help me build my inator! Hurry! Quick!
Vanessa: What're we doing?
Doofenshmirtz: Building a Time-Straighten-Out-inator.
Vanessa: (sighs) Dad, we really need to talk!
(Agent P arrives.)
Doofenshmirtz: There you are! Perry the Platypus, grab a screwdriver and help us!
♪ Perry! ♪
(Cut back to the gang.)
Baljeet: Okay, this paper towel represents the space-time continuum. Normally, it moves in a straight line, (he puts the paper towel on a hook) but something has disrupted the flow. Now time cannot move forward and it puts enormous strain on the fabric of time (tears the paper towel) and tears the fabric! So now there is a little less space-time fabric to work with. The days are getting shorter. Now, you take this shortened piece of space-time (puts the paper towel on the hook and tears it again) and loop it again. Do this enough times (crumples the paper towel and puts it in his pocket) and pretty soon you do not have anything left. What I cannot seem to figure out is what could have possibly caused the space-time disruption in the first place? And an even bigger conundrum is how Candace is standing outside of the space-time interruption and somehow knew about its effects.
(The gang looks at Candace.)
Candace: (nervous chuckle as she pulls on her shirt collar) Yeah, that's a puzzler. But you know that old saying: "Never question the source of a...temporal time...space...loop thingy."  Heh heh. Eh.
Phineas: Really?
Buford: Yeah, I've heard that.
Baljeet: Well, we have to build something to close the hole and stop the looping.  But it will require einsteinium, tungsten wire, and micro-crystal plasma resistors.
Phineas: Well, stuff keeps getting sucked into this place. Maybe we can find a hi-tech machine or some lab equipment that uses all of that stuff.
Buford: What about this machine right here?
Phineas: Wow. Strange that we didn't notice that.
(Cut to reveal the Do-Over-inator. Ferb opens the top of the inator.)
Phineas: Einsteinium, tungsten wire, plasma resistors! Wow, this is awesome!
Candace: Don't touch that thing! (running to the inator) That's the machine that started all of...this...So...um...yeah...you gotta be careful with that thing.
Baljeet: And you know this how?
Candace: (sighs) When I was at Vanessa's, I may have accidentally intentionally pushed the button.
All but Ferb: (gasp)
Candace: Okay, I was having a rotten day. One crummy thing after another kept happening and when he told me that this thing can make the day start over again, I just couldn't help myself. And then the days just kept looping and I know I should've said something sooner, but I kept coming closer to busting you guys! And I swear I had no idea it would do any of this. I thought I'd get one do-over and that would be that, but then I saw it was creating problems and making things disappear and making people forget, but by the time I tried to stop it, it was too late, and I lost you guys! And I don't know how to fix it!
Buford: Well, if this thing's the problem, maybe we should press this big self-destruct button.
Baljeet: NOOOOO! If time stops looping, there will be no big tears in the fabric of space-time and no way for us to get home. We must find a way to get ourselves and that machine through one of the rifts and back into Danville. Then we can push the button and blow up the machine.
Buford: I call pressing the button!
Phineas: Come on, gang! We know what we have to do today!
(A tiger roars.)
Buford: Yeah. RUUUUUUUNN!!! (The gang runs away.)

(The gang have completed building a rather fancy looking catapult.)
Phineas: Well, it's not pretty, but we did it.
Buford: I dub thee "The Buford van Stomm Time Catapult". I won the naming rights fair and square.
Phineas: C'mon, guys! No time to lose! How's it lookin', Baljeet?
Baljeet: It looks like the next anomaly will appear any second now. I am working on the exact coordinates, but there is significant interference. It looks like there may be multiple rifts coming.
Phineas: As long as we can hit one of 'em. Stand by your hand cranks, people!
Baljeet: Here they come!
(Automobiles begin to fall from the sky.)
Phineas: It's cars! Baljeet, what are those coordinates?!
Baljeet: Got them! 34 degrees, 10 minutes, 15 seconds north. 15 minutes, zero seconds west.
Phineas: Launch now!
(The catapult is launched.)
Candace: Where is the tear?! Where is the tear?!
Baljeet: Any second!
(A rift suddenly appears in front of them.)
The gang: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!
(The gang get sucked into the rift.)

Act VI
(Scene opens on Doof's lab.)
Doofenshmirtz: How're ya doin' back there, Perry the Platypus?
(Perry emerges from under the inator and gives a thumbs up.)
Doofenshmirtz: Takes care of that. Let's plug this baby in and get her goin'!
Vanessa: Are you sure it'll work?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, yeah, absolutely. There's a guaranteed 55% chance of success, so we're...we're good to go.
Vanessa: Wait, so there's still a 45% chance that it won't do anything?
Doofenshmirtz: Of course not, it's not gonna do nothing. There's also a 45% chance it'll destroy everything in existence.
Vanessa: What?! Dad, you have to tell us things like this!
(Cut to the backyard. Phineas and the gang crash land back and the Do-Over-inator tumbles into a position far away from them.)
Phineas: Is everyone okay?
Buford: Aw, my muffins got smashed.
Candace: Come on! No time to lose! Literally!
(They run up to the Do-Over-inator.)
Phineas: Okay, Baljeet, just to confirm, destroying the machine will put the space-time continuum back to normal.
Baljeet: Yes. And we need to do it quickly. The time loops are accelerating exponentially and—
(Clock transition.)
(Cut to Doof once again finishing his inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh. We're starting here now. Hey, it has been brought to my attention that I should tell you guys there's a 55% chance this will work, but a 45% chance that it'll destroy reality as we know it.
Vanessa: What?!
Doofenshmirtz: Absolute worst-case scenario.
Vanessa: Okay, what happens if we don't push it?
Doofenshmirtz: If we do nothing, there's a hundred percent chance that the time pocket will dissolve and it'll destroy every— Y'know, there's a whole illustration I can do with a paper towel and a hook, but I don't have time.
Vanessa: Okay, we have to take a moment and think about the—
(Clock transition.)
(Cut to the backyard. Phineas and the gang crash land back and the Do-Over-inator tumbles into a position far away from them.)
Buford: Oh, man! That was quick!
Phineas: The days must be compressing to this exact point!
Candace: No time to lose! Move! Move! Move!
(She and the gang run up to the inator.)
Phineas: Hurry, guys!
(Clock transition.)
(Cut to Doof once again finishing his inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, here's the odds. Save the day: 55%. Destroy the universe as we know it: 45%. But do nothing at all: a hundred percent chance of the end of time. So whadaya say?
Vanessa: Whoa.
Doofenshmirtz: Good answer! How 'bout you, Perry the Platypus? Come on, if you got something to say, now's the time.
(Perry starts to open his mouth to chatter, but the clock transition appears again.)
(Cut to the backyard. Phineas and the gang crash land back and the Do-Over-inator tumbles into a position far away from them.)
(Candace begins to run up to the inator, then stops and gets a spoon out of her skirt.)
Phineas: (offscreen) The time loop is getting too short!
Buford: (offscreen) What if I throw Baljeet?
Baljeet: (offscreen) You are just using this as an excuse!
(Clock transition.)
(Cut to Doof once again finishing his inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, I gotta tell ya, there's a lot of risk involved, but we've discussed it over, like, three loops already, and I think this is our only option. Are you with me?
Vanessa: Yeah, I am.
(Doof smiles and looks at Perry.)
Perry: (thumbs up and chatters approvingly)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, I should have just about enough time to press this button if I'm not too overly dramatic about it.
(Cut back to the backyard. Phineas and the gang are already on the ground.)
Phineas: We can't reach it! There's just not enough time!
(Candace hurls the spoon at the inator. Split screen to the spoon, Candace, and Doof in slow motion. The spoon hits the self-destruct button and Doof hits his inator button. Both Doof and Candace, along with the spoon, swirl around in a blue vortex. Clock transition. Cut to the gang lying around the tree. They get up.)
Baljeet: D-Did it work?
Phineas: (gasps)
Linda: Okay, kids. Pie's almost ready. Anybody want some fresh orange juice in the meantime?
Lawrence: I used a spoon to squeeze them.
Buford: Orange juice!
Isabella: Yay!
Buford: There's the emotional attachment to oranges I've been lackin'! (He gives Isabella a high eight.)
(Cut back to Doof's lab.)
Doofenshmirtz: Well, we're not destroyed, so that's a good sign.
Vanessa: Uh, but did it work?
Norm: Muffin time, sir!
Doofenshmirtz: We are back in business, baby girl! (hugs Vanessa)
Vanessa: Yes! Dad, I'm so proud of you! You did it!
Doofenshmirtz: Aw, I'd do anything for you, pumpkin pants! After we dismantle this thing, I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself. I've got no experience being a good guy.
Vanessa: Well, I'll stick around and help you figure it out. I hear OWCA is looking for a few good animals.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, I was raised by ocelots!
(Perry discovers the inator wasn't even plugged in, but decides to let Doof have this victory.)
(Cut to the backyard where the gang are enjoying their orange juice glasses.)
Candace: Now, that was an eventful day!
Baljeet: That was an eventful summer.
Isabella: What was your favorite part, Phineas?
Phineas: Of the summer?
Isabella: Yeah! What was your favorite thing we built?
Phineas: Memories.
Buford: Oh, come on!
Baljeet: Oh, really corny!
Phineas: No, I'm serious! We've done a lot of great stuff. How can I choose?
Buford: Yeah! Remember the time we went into space??
Baljeet: Which time?
Buford: The time we made the ice cream! Duh!
Isabella: And remember the rollercoaster, where we...
