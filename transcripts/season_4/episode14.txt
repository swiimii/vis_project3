Part I
Announcer: From the PFT Studios in still moderately charming and majestic downtown Danville, it's—
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, yeah, we know the drill. We've hosted before. (pointing to Major Monogram) He's good, I'm evil, blah blah blah.
Major Monogram: I, for one, am excited to be here.
Doofenshmirtz: I'm all tingly! I've actually got butterflies in my sto—
Announcer: Let me finish my introduction! Welcome to Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown Hosted by...Kelly Osbourne! (Timpani drum plays as Doof and Monogram get questionable looks on their faces.) And now, here's our host: She's a singer, an actor, a fashionista du jour, Kelly Osbourne!
(Massive applause. Pan on the audience, which includes Millie and Holly. A live-action Kelly appears on the stage next to Doof and Monogram.)
Kelly Osbourne: Hi, everybody! What'cha doin'? I have always wanted to say that. I am so excited to be here. I promise you guys, this is gonna be a rockin' show full of surprises. And anyone who knows anything about me, they know that I absolutely LOVE Phineas and Ferb! And being a singer myself, I love love LOVE the songs.
Doofenshmirtz: Wai-wai-wai-, w-what's goin' on here?! We are the hosts!
Major Monogram: Yeah, and, uh, aren't you a little too three-dimensional to host an animated show, young lady?
Kelly Osbourne: Yes. Yes, I am. But I'm doing it anyway, so just deal with it.
Doofenshmirtz: But w-we have hosting contracts and everything!
Kelly Osbourne: Did you read your contract?
Doofenshmirtz: Nobody reads them, they're like a hundred pages long and pages 2 through 99 are useless, like, like parsley on a dinner plate. Nobody eats it. Y'know, if they're gonna put stuff on your plate that y-you're not gonna eat, why not make it something useful, like a-like a keychain or, or gold doubloons.
Kelly Osbourne: Dude, why are you rambling on about parsley? You're bringing the entire energy of the show down! Maybe you guys can be my co-hosts!
Doofenshmirtz: Co-hosts? I don't like the sound of that. Sounds like a demotion.
Kelly Osbourne: Enough of you two. (to the audience) You guys ready? Let's get this party started! (applause) There were so many songs to pick from, I mean, just take a look at all of them.
(She points to the screen behind her, which shows practically all of the songs that have been on the show.)
Major Monogram: Wow, that is a lot of songs.
Kelly Osbourne: You guys voted and now we're gonna rock the top 10! Here's number 10!
(Song #10: Candace Party)
Guy: Is this the Phineas and Ferb party?
Guy #2: Sure is.
Guy: Phineas and Ferb parties rule! (all cheering)
Candace: It's not their party, it's my party! And it's not a party, it's an intimate get together. (Shattering) (Gasps) What was that? Put that down, pardon me, use a napkin! What's my science teacher doing here?
Teacher: I never miss a Phineas and Ferb party!
Candace: First of all, it's not a party, but if it were a party, it would not be their party, it would be MY PARTY!

(Kelly waves and blows a kiss to the camera.)
Doofenshmirtz: (groans) Demoted to co-host.
Kelly Osbourne: I've been a co-host before and I had a blast doing it!
Doofenshmirtz: Well, goody gumdrops for you!
Major Monogram: Don't worry, Kelly. I am totally down for being second banana.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, first of all, that's a little sad. But, second of all, technically, you would be third banana. It would go: Kelly, and then me, and then you. And, ih, I would be second banana.
Kelly Osbourne: Nobody is a banana, because there are no bananas!
Major Monogram: Yes, we have no bananas!
Kelly Osbourne: Here's the song rolling in at number 9!
(Song #9: Come Home Perry)

Buford: (Comes and takes Candace's microphone) Good job, Larry.
Candace: Welcome home.
Kelly Osbourne: This is going to be a fantastic countdown! Um, just one thing, guys. We seriously have to do something about your...fashion. It's just not working.
Major Monogram: Uh, really?
Kelly Osbourne: You look a bit, like, stiff and-and uniformy. Right, guys?
Major Monogram: Uniformy? Is that even a word?
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, "uniformy." If you look it up, there's a picture of you.
Kelly Osbourne: You're one to talk.
Doofenshmirtz: What?
Kelly Osbourne: I mean that whole laboratory look was was never in, I mean, even if you are an "evil scientist". You should try a cape.
Doofenshmirtz: A cape? Where am I gonna get a cape at this hour?
Major Monogram: You could try a Nehru jacket.
Kelly Osbourne: Well, go and get changed then.
Doofenshmirtz: (leaving with Monogram) If I could get a Nehru jacket, I could get a cape.
Kelly Osbourne: (shakes head) Men. While my co-hosts go backstage and bring their fashions into this century, here's song 8.
(Song #8: I'm Me)

Doofenshmirtz: (offscreen) Wa-wa-wait!
Major Monogram: Yeah, hold the boat.
(Doof and Monogram come back onstage dressed up like Kelly, right down to her purple hair.)
Doofenshmirtz: Mind you, this does not mean in any way, shape, or hair color, that I am your co-host. I-I'm just sayin'.
Kelly Osbourne: Wow! Now I know what I would look like if I had middle-aged male clones.
Major Monogram: Oh, I can't believe I let myself get talked into this. It's embarrassing and, if I'm being honest, a bit drafty.
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, just go with it, Francis. (to Kelly) Hey, l-look at this! Strike a pose! Look, look, look, I'm vo—
Kelly Osbourne: Vogueing?! I love vogueing! It's so '90's!
Major Monogram: I was a bit of a secret voguer myself.
Kelly Osbourne: Really?
Doofenshmirtz: It wasn't a secret.
Kelly Osbounre: You know what we should do then? Strike a pose.
(The crowd goes wild while Osbourne, Doof and Monogram vogue it out.)
Doofenshmirtz: Vogue. Vogueing. That's it. Look it up, kids. That's what the internet is for.
Major Monogram: That was fun! Great idea, Kelly.
Kelly Osbourne: Thank you.
Doofenshmirtz: But, but, vogueing was my idea! I started to say "vogueing" and you just cut me off right before when I just got "vo" out. Y'know, I— (to Monogram) What did you think I was gonna say? Vociferous? What other words start with "vo"?
Major Monogram: Give it a rest, Heinz. (to Kelly) He's always like this.
Doofenshmirtz: That's it! That is it! You will rue the day that you demoted Heinz Doofenshmirtz to co-host! (he leaves)
Kelly Osbourne: Hmm. You know what that means?
Major Monogram: I think I do.
Kelly Osbourne: (singsongy) More hosting for us!
Major Monogram: All right! Here's a little ditty I like to call "Song Number 7"!

Kelly Osbourne: Are you guys having as much fun as I am? (crowd cheers)
Major Monogram: Yes! Now that I'm back in my old clothes, uniformy or not. I predict the Nehru jacket will make a comeback.
Kelly Osbourne: Mmm. Not gonna happen.
Major Monogram: Oh.
Kelly Osbourne: But you know what is gonna happen? Song number 6!
(Song #6: City of Love)
Isabella: So Phineas, what do you think of the City of Love?
Phineas: I wish it was the City of Airplane Parts.
Isabella: Oh, you're just too stressed. You should take a moment to relax and enjoy it.
♪ We could share a crêpe sucrée ♪

Phineas: Huh. That awning could be used as a sail. Or, you know, a parachute. Depending on how things go.
Isabella: ♪ Take a break and smell these flowers ♪

Part II
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, little Miss Osbourne, (coming back onstage with an inator helmet on his head and a remote) prepare to say hello to your doom (Agent P appears on one of the rafters above the soundstage.) at the hands of—or, I guess in this case, in the head of—the man who is not your co-host! (Perry holds onto a rope with one hand and holds a mirror in the other.)
(Doof pushes the button. Kelly ducks. Perry swings from the rope and the ray hits the mirror and zaps Doof making him disappear.)
Kelly Osbourne: Wow. That was close.
(Cut to the Baby alien's dimension. Doof appears in the crib.)
Doofenshmirtz: Wait. Was that Perry the Platypus? Great. They're probably letting him host the show.
(Cut back to the studio. Perry drops down and lands onto the stage.)
♪ Perry! ♪
Kelly Osbourne: Everyone welcome Perry! (massive applause) Oh my gosh, this day just keeps getting better and better! You know, I was hoping you'd stop by. Do you...Do you want to introduce the next song?

Kelly Osbourne: That last song just makes me wanna move and groove, but enough about me. Because I have a surprise for everyone. (applause) A friend of mine wanted to stop by and say hi, so please, put your hands together and give a warm welcome to Maia Mitchell!
(A live-action Maia appears and waves and hugs Kelly.)
Maia Mitchell: Hi! I was watching from backstage and I could not wait to get out here! I love all the songs so far!
Kelly Osbourne: I know, right? Aren't they fun?
Maia Mitchell: Yeah, they're amazing! And, Kelly, you are doing an awesome job of hosting. Isn't she? (encourages applause) No, no, you're great! And, Major Monogram, I'm Maia. (shakes Monogram's hand)
Major Monogram: Pleasure to meet you, young lady.
Maia Mitchell: And Perry! I love you! You're my favorite, actually, because, we have something in common.
Kelly Osbourne: What's that?
Maia Mitchell: We're both from Australia.

Doofenshmirtz: That can be your catchphrase! You're the grumpy one. (Pokes him) Eh?
Maia Mitchell: There are so many great songs!
Kelly Osbourne: I know! What did you think about that last song, Perry?
(Perry chatters and gives a thumbs up)
Maia Mitchell: I have a...I have a confession.
Kelly Osbourne: What's that?
Maia Mitchell: I might, uh, make Perry noises when no one's looking.
Kelly Osbourne: (gasps) You're kidding! Me, too!
Maia Mitchell: You do?
Kelly Osbourne: All the time!
Major Monogram: Make that three!
Carl: Sir, I just wanted to check to see if you— (freaks out) MAIA MITCHELL!!! I'm your biggest fan! Love your voice and your work!

Maia Mitchell: Yeah!
Kelly Osbourne: You ready?
Maia Mitchell: Yeah.
Kelly Osbourne: (to Monogram) You ready? (Monogram cracks his knuckles) Okay.
(Kelly begins, followed by Maia and then Monogram and Carl.)
Kelly Osbourne: (laughs) Nobody does it better than Perry.

Kelly Osbourne: You think? Anyway, let's get back to the countdown. Here's number 3.

Doofenshmirtz: (Chuckles while sweating) Who's up for charades?
(Perry beckons Doofenshmirtz from under the table)
Perry the Platypus, what are you doing down here?
(When he reemerges, he is wearing the Devolition-ator helmet, and making a beat with the records glued to his fingers. Perry is controlling him underneath the DJ table)

Doofenshmirtz: She thinks I'm cool!
(The crowd cheers)
Kelly Osbourne: You know what'd be really cool? To write a song so next year the song can be on the countdown!
Major Monogram: Well, as a fellow musician, I heartily agree.
Kelly Osbourne: Oh, you're a musician?
Major Monogram: Well, yes. From, uh, from time to time, I like to strum the (speaks the Hawaiian pronunciation) ukulele.
(Doof suddenly reappears.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah!
(Crowd exclaims)
Doofenshmirtz: Uhhhh, did I miss Maia Mitchell?
Kelly Osbourne: I'm afraid so.
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, bummer. Anyway, as a musician, not as a co-host, mind you, I'd like to get in on this little songwriting thing you're about to do.
Kelly Osbourne: What do you play?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, several things, by my instrument of choice is the kazoo.
Kelly Osbourne: You rock the kaz?
Doofenshmirtz: I do.
Kelly Osbourne: Fine! Let's start with the lyrics then. Maybe we can do some sort of a round robin kinda thing and write a line, and the next person can rhyme it.
Major Monogram: Oh, good idea. Ahem. Me first, me first. Uh, let's see. "When I wake up in the morning sun..."
Kelly Osbourne: "I realize you're the only one."
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, now it's me. ♪ "And by the moon that's, oh, so silver." ♪
Kelly Osbourne: Dude, really?
Doofenshmirtz: What? What?
Kelly Osbourne: There's no rhyme for the word "silver".
Major Monogram: She's right.

Kelly Osbourne: What is a bilver?
Doofenshmirtz: It's a...water moving thingy.

Doofenshmirtz: Oh. I've always called it a bilver. Okay, how about this? ♪ "And by the moon that's oh, so, orange." ♪
Major Monogram: Oy.
Doofenshmirtz: Is that better?

Part III
Kelly Osbourne: Right, guys, before we roll our last clip, I have to know something. Do you have a favorite song on the countdown?
Major Monogram: Well, I'm, uh, I'm particularly partial to number three.
Doofenshmirtz: And I like number seven, that's my lucky number. (The background starts to ripple.) It all started when I was seven years old, back in Drusselstein—
Kelly Osbourne: W-W-Wait a minute. You're doing a flashback.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, yeah, it's kinda my thing. I do a lot of these (stammers)
Kelly Osbourne: Um, we can't fit that in.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, what if I make it short?
Kelly Osbourne: We still don't have time because...it's the moment we've all been waiting for!!! And I can't believe this, but you all picked my favorite song as the number one song! You guys have fabulous taste, I'm just saying. You guys ready? It's... Everything's Better with Perry!!!
(Song #1: Everything's Better with Perry)
(Phineas's alarm clock rings 7:00 and a mechanical arm emerges out of it and pokes a sleeping Perry awake, he chatters, waking Phineas and Ferb)
Phineas: Good morning, Perry! Now that's the way to wake up. (He hugs Perry) This is gonna be the best day ever.

Kelly Osbourne: Well, this has been the most amazing day! And to quote my favorites, Phineas and Ferb, "The best day ever!"
Major Monogram: I completely concur.
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, okay, I've been reconsidering and I'm going to give in. I'm totally gonna be your co-host.
Kelly Osbourne: That's great. But—
Doofenshmirtz: So what are my co-hosting duties? What's next on the old co-hosting train I jumped aboard? What do I do?
Kelly Osbourne: Say goodbye, Dr. D.
Doofenshmirtz: That's it? Goodbye, Dr. D!
Major Monogram: Goodbye.
Kelly Osbourne: Thank you so much, everybody, that was so much fun! I'm gonna be singing these songs all day! See ya next time!
(Kelly, Doofenshmirtz and Monogram wave goodbye. The credits roll over a montage of clips from all the songs shown.)
