(Open to a large pit, walking along a cliff with lava surrounding them, a chained up Phineas, Ferb, Candace and Dr. Doofenshmirtz are trudging to their doom. At the end of the path, a giant ferocious monster, the Goozim, is in a cage, it roars loudly, blowing their hair back)
Phineas: I'll be honest, Ferb. I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this. But, I guess that's life, huh? One minute you're having the best day ever, the next you're being fed to a monster the size of a two car garage.
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah? Well, welcome to MY life! (the Goozim roars, he hides behind a robot)
Phineas: Huh. And everything started out so well this morning.

EARLIER THAT DAY
(Pan in to the boys' bedroom. The Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension logo pops up. Phineas's alarm clock rings 7:00 and a mechanical arm emerges out of it and pokes a sleeping Perry awake, he chatters, waking Phineas and Ferb)
Phineas: Good morning, Perry! Now that's the way to wake up. (He hugs Perry) This is gonna be the best day ever.
(The boys get dressed and ready for the day)

(Phineas, Ferb, and Perry slide down the staircase railing and land in a pile on the floor, Perry chatters)
Lawrence: Good morning, boys.
Linda: Happy anniversary, Perry.
Phineas: Oh, that's right! Gosh, I can't believe it's been five years. I remember the day we first got you.

(Flashback to 5 years ago, Lawrence and Linda take a younger Phineas, Ferb, and Candace to the "OWCA Animal Rescue Center")
Lawrence: Come on, kids. Pick out any pet you want.
Linda: Oh look, Phineas! This one's looking at you! (picks up Phineas and shows him a cat)
Lawrence: And this one's looking at you, Ferb! (picks up Ferb and shows him a dog)
Young Candace: (walks through the aquarium section and all the fish swim away as she approaches) Why won't anything look at ME?!
(Phineas and Ferb approaches a baby Perry)
Young Phineas: Ferb! This one's looking at both of us at the same time!
(Baby Perry chatters)
Linda: Awww...
Young Candace: That thing? You're kidding, right?
(A female store employee approaches them)
Store employee: Is there something I can do for you?
Lawrence: Ah, yes, we'd like that one, please.
Store employee: (surprised) You want to adopt the platypus?
Lawrence: Oh, is that what it is? Well, yes! May we have him please?
Young Candace: What would you even name a platypus?
Phineas: (Narrating) 'Course, Ferb and I knew exactly what to call you.
Young Phineas and Ferb: (simultaneously) Bartholomew!
(Baby Perry chatters)

(Present)
Phineas: And then when we got you home, we renamed you Perry. And gave you this locket!
(Phineas reaches into Perry's fur and pulls out a web foot shaped locket on a collar. He opens the locket around Perry's neck, revealing three pictures, one of young Phineas, Ferb, and Perry)
Look how young we all were.

Candace: (in her room, talking with her cell phone) Hey Jeremy, you wanna go to the mall?
Jeremy: (At his house) You know, I'd love to, but my Dad is taking me to check out his old college today.
Jack Johnson: (runs in) Boo-ya! Go Polecats! Boo-ya! (he runs away)
Jeremy: He's already set up an interview with the academic adviser. Can you believe that?
Candace: Gee, Jeremy. I forgot you're a whole year older than me. A trip to college? Heh-heh.. That's, that's really great. Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
(Hangs up phone and picks up a stuffed teddy bear with a picture of Jeremy taped to its face)
(to the teddy bear) Oh, Jeremy! In the blink of an eye, you'll be moving on to the next phase of your life. You'll be going to college and wearing tweed jackets with patches on the elbows! You'll be so mature! And look at ME! I'm a child! Jeremy, you'll see! I can mature! Starting with taking this silly photo off. (rips off photo) Oh, Mr. Miggins! Have you been there the whole time?

(The two boys are in the backyard; Ferb is placing a baseball on Perry's tail)
Phineas: (holding a baseball bat and tapping the home plate) Alright, looks like the pitcher's ready, and...batter up!
(Ferb scratches Perry's neck and Perry's tail snaps forward, flinging the baseball toward Phineas)
Batter batter batter, swing! (swings at the baseball and hits) Oh yes, sports fans! That may be the best hit ever in the history of platypult baseball!
(Ferb checks the "Platypult Baseball World Record Book" and gives Phineas a thumbs up)
And the crowd exhales loudly through their mouths! (imitates a roaring crowd)
(Ferb uses the remote control baseball glove to guide the ball back)
And Fletcher snags the pop fly! He's out!
Isabella: (enters) Hi, Phineas! What'cha doin'?
Phineas: Turning Perry's involuntary reflex into sporting event.
Isabella: Hi, Perry! Can I try? (scratches Perry's neck and the baseball is catapulted out of the yard)
Phineas: Whoa, mama! Nice shot, Isabella!
Baljeet: (enters along with Buford) Did someone lose a ball?
Phineas: Yeah, we were just playing platypult.
Baljeet: Oh, I LOVE Platypus-themed sports!
Phineas: You know, if we had TWO Perrys, we could put a net between them and play platypult badminton!
Buford: Who's Annette?
Phineas: Ferb, that's it! I know what we're gonna do today!
Buford: No, seriously. Who's Annette?

(They finish up a mechanical platypult)
Phineas: Okay, everyone. I think the tail is all set. I'll just go check with the foreman.
Isabella: (noticing Perry's absence) He's gone!
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry? (he checks under the machine) Did he really slip away? On his anniversary? Sometimes it seems like Perry's missed every single cool thing we've done all summer long. Well, I guess he can do whatever he wants. After all, it's HIS day, right?
(Perry is shown hiding behind the tree, his fedora on. He throws a pebble at the fence)
Baljeet: Hey, what was the small noise?
Phineas: Let's all go walk over to it!

(Perry slips into the house while they're gone, he goes to the couch and pulls back a mirror over it, revealing a hole, he goes in and rides a vacuum tube down to his lair, passing by Pinky the Chihuahua and other agents, as he lands at his seat, Major Monogram is on screen)
Major Monogram: Ah, good morning, Agent P. A quick word, recently you've been having some close calls, and your host family has nearly caught you sneaking into your lair several times. No need to remind you, but I'll do it anyway, that if your cover's blown, you'll have to be transferred to another city, with another host family. And we both know you wouldn't like that. (chuckles) I remember the day you were first assigned.

(Flashback to when the Flynn-Fletcher family was just walking out of the adoption agency with their new platypus)
Female store employee: Enjoy your platypus!
Lawrence: Thank you! Cheerio!
(the employee takes off her head, revealing it's a mask, under it is a younger Carl with braces on)
Younger Carl: (into a headset) Agent assignment complete, sir.
Younger Monogram: (inside a computer-filled room) Good job, Carl! If you keep up the great work, you'll make unpaid intern in no time!

(Present)
Carl: (off screen) And I did!
Major Monogram: Don't get cocky, Carl! Agent P, as you know, every operative is equipped with an auto-scan replication device, just like the one in your hat. We've been using the information you've gathered to replicate each and every one of Dr. Doofenshmirtz's inators. Our top men have been analyzing them to determine if they've been getting smarter or dumber. And, to be honest, the jury's still out. Now we find out that he's in the process of building an alternate dimension-related inator. Your assignment is to stop him, before he finishes building it. Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor, is Carl with some high-tech devices that you might find useful.
(A platform rises with dramatic music, on it is a large container of devices)
Carl: (off-screen) Um, Sir? Hello? I didn't step on in time. Would you mind lowering the platform again?
Major Monogram: Oh, great, let me... cue the music again.
(Rewind dramatic music and plays it again as Carl rises with the platform this time)
Carl: Voilà monsieur! (He shows a wristwatch) This first item is our new wrist-communicationizer. It has many applications that will help you in the field. For example a powerful directional electro-magnet. It will draw any metal object to you. (He pushes a button and his glasses are drawn to it) See? And these are aluminum!
Major Monogram: Quit goofing around, Carl, and show him the hologram.
Carl: Yes, sir. (he pushes a button on the watch and turns on hologram of Major Monogram)
Major Monogram: Hehe, pretty nifty, huh? (from the hologram) With this device, you'll be able to contact me anywhere at anytime, but don't call between 3:30 and 4:00, because...that's when I take a shower. Whoa wee, wait a minute. (Points to Monogram on the big screen) Is that... me?
Carl: Oh, no! His holographic projection has become mesmerized by his video image! I better shut it off.
(He shuts off the hologram, then points to the watch again)
And if you push THIS button, it'll give your adversary an incredible ice cream headache.
(He pushes button and immediately screams and holds his head in pain, then stops)
It's gone. You better watch where you point that. (He hands the watch over to Perry)

(Candace, inside her room, is shown packing her belongings into a cardboard box)
Stacy: (enters) Hey, girl. Uh, what are you doing?
Candace: Stacy, Jeremy's going to college soon, and here I am concerned with busting my brothers to my MOMMY and living in the NURSERY. (She picks up a ceramic unicorn) A unicorn! A UNICORN, Stacy! (mockingly) "Hi, I'm six!" You've GOTTA help me get rid of all this junk.
Stacy: Wow, bold move!
Candace: Yep! Goodbye, childhood folly. Hello, carefree undemanding adult life!
Linda: (enters) Yeah, good luck with that. Candace, your father and I are off to the movies. While we're gone, you're in charge, okay?
Candace: Okay, Mom! (to Stacy) And you know, I'm even thinking of giving up on busting my brothers.
Stacy: The irony is, that as a grown up, you don't NEED to tell your mom. You can just bust them yourself.
Candace: (gasps) That's it! Stacy, I'm old enough to bust them myself!
Stacy: That's what I just said.

♪Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!♪
Doofenshmirtz: Now, Perry the Platypus, quake in terror, as I punch a hole through to another dimension! (shows his Other Dimensionator) Behold! The Other-Dimension...
Norm: Sir!
Doofenshmirtz: What? What?
Norm: (in front of a large buffet table) I've finished setting up the buffet.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, for crying out loud, Norm. I was in the zone!
Norm: I just thought you were playing with your doll.
Doofenshmirtz: It's not a doll, it's a stand-in. Pretendy the Practice-pus, see? I wonder if Perry the Platypus practices with a fake me? It would be nice to know he cares about...(tennis ball eye falls off the stand-in)

(Cut to Phineas and Ferb's backyard, the mechanical platypult is finished and Phineas and Ferb are inside the giant shuttlecock)
Phineas: All systems are green, prepare to launch on my mark, T-minus thirty and counting. 29, 28, 27, 26...

(at Perry's lair)
Carl: ...Of course, you'll only need this if you're attacked by one of the royals or a member of Parliament, so it's probably okay to leave the safety on. And here's your brand new rocket-car. (He shows it as Perry gets in and starts it) Sweet huh? Good luck, Agent P!
(Perry rides on the car)
Major Monogram: Uh, Carl, did you tell him the accelerator's a little touchy?
(The rocket car roars off, hitting the ceiling directly)
Carl: I think he knows, sir.

(at the backyard)
Phineas: ...3, 2, 1, service!
(Isabella pushes a button marked INVOLUNTARY REFLEX, and the platypult launches them, at the same time, Perry's rocket car bursts out of the ground nearby and collides with it, sending them both careening away from each other, Candace and Stacy run into the backyard)
Candace: Phineas and Ferb, you are so bus... Oh my gosh! Where'd it go? You there! Small children! Where's the big contraption?
Isabella: I don't know, it was here just a moment ago.
Candace: It disappeared! Stacy, do you realize what this means?
Stacy: We're done?
Candace: No, some mysterious force always takes away Phineas and Ferb's inventions before Mom shows up, this time, it took it away before I showed up! The mysterious force recognizes that I'm now a grown-up!
Stacy: "Mysterious Force"?, I'm not buying it, I am a woman of science, at least that's what my horoscope said.   

Candace: Well I'm going to prove it to you and bust my brothers at the same time, Where are my brothers?
Baljeet: We just launched them toward the park, Buford is there with the other platypult.
Candace: Okay children, as the adult here, I decree we're going to the park, does anyone have to go potty first? (Stacy raises her hand) Fine, make it quick.

(in the air)
Phineas: Ferb! It looks like we're going to hit that building that looks vaguely like your head!

(at DEI)
Doofenshmirtz: Time to give it a little test. (he turns it on, it starts for a brief second, then shuts down) Hmm. Well I just finished it, it can't be broken already.
(Phineas and Ferb smash into it)
Doofenshmirtz: (sighs) I stand corrected.
(Phineas and Ferb get out of the shuttlecock) Alright, what's with the giant shuttlecock?
Phineas: We're really sorry, sir, I don't know what happened, one minute we were innocently launching ourselves across the city in a badminton platypult, the next thing we know, we're bouncing on up to the east side to your deluxe apartment in the sky.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, it looks like you've totaled my Other-Dimensionator.
Phineas: An Other-Dimensionator? What does it do?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, at the moment, it just stops giant shuttlecocks, apparently, but it's supposed to let me go into other dimensions.
Phineas: Oh, that's cool! We can help you fix it. I'm Phineas and this is my brother Ferb.
Doofenshmirtz: I'm Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, but my friends call me.... (stops and thinks) I just got into such a funk.
Phineas: Ferb is naturally handy with tools, I'll bet we could put this thing back together again in no time.
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, what the heck, before we set up, there's a whole buffet here, please partake, I was expecting someone who seems to be running late.

(Meanwhile, Perry is on the ground, his smoking rocket car is being picked up by a tow truck)
Driver: You're lucky I got a rocket car winch, lots of guys don't have that.

(Back to DEI, the boys have restored the Other-Dimensionator)
Phineas: Almost there, okay, field compressor attaches to the auxiliary generator, was this working before?
Doofenshmirtz: Well if by "working", you mean "functioning properly", then, uh, no.
Phineas: Well I think I see your problem, everything is wired through this self-destruct button, do you even need that?
Doofenshmirtz: Well of course I need tha... Wait! No I don't, I do not need that, you are absolutely right, huh.
Phineas: So Ferb has rigged up this remote control, so that if we get separated from the portal, we can open another one.
Doofenshmirtz: Huh, nice touch, kid.
Phineas: I guess this is the last piece, okay Ferb, boost me up. (Ferb lifts him)
(Suddenly, Perry crashes through the window on his jet-pack, ready to attack, he stops as he sees the boys and lands, his eyes dart nervously as he looks)
Doofenshmirtz: Ooh, I cannot wait!
(Perry takes a step back, Phineas glances and Perry is back in pet mode, he chatters)
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry.
Doofenshmirtz: Perry?
Phineas: Yeah, he's our pet platypus.
Doofenshmirtz: Is every platypus named Perry?
Phineas: In a perfect world, yes.
Doofenshmirtz: Aww, well he's a cute little fella, hi there. (he tickles Perry's chin) Gootchie... (Perry chomps down on his finger) OW OW OW!
Phineas: Perry, no! (He and Ferb pull him off) We do not bite the elderly!
Doofenshmirtz: Again, Ow. No, it's okay, platypuses don't typically like me.
Phineas: Well Perry, you're just in time to see us open up a portal to another dimension.
(Perry's eyes widen, Phineas and Ferb are about to put the piece in, when Perry leaps and grabs it in his mouth)
Perry, what are you doing?
(Perry goes under the buffet table, Phineas and Ferb grab the piece and pull)
Perry, no, this is not tug of war, this is not tug of war! (Phineas pulls the piece out) Silly boy, what's gotten into him?
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, let's get this show on the road, huh?
Major Monogram: (his head appears beside Perry) Remember, if your cover's blown, you'll never see the boys again.
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, does anyone hear someone talking?
Major Monogram: (actually the hologram on Perry's watch) Never see them again...
(Perry covers the watch and walks over to the nearby couch)
Phineas: Okay, here we go, (Ferb lifts him) right in he...
(Perry suddenly pees on the couch, he then jumps off)
Phineas: Perry, no! (He and Ferb run over) Not on the sofa! (Ferb picks him up) Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. D, we should take him outside.
Doofenshmirtz: No no, it's alright. (he turns over the cushion) I was planning on replacing this old couch anyway. Now come on, let's light this pop stand, or however the saying goes.
(Perry looks nervous as they go to the machine, Phineas inserts the piece and it powers up)
You know its, its kinda weird, I'm usually thwarted by this point, huh, I guess he's not coming.
(he turns it on, a portal forms) And now, the mind blowing first images from beyond our dimensional reality!
(Their eyes all widen as it forms, and then a room with a couch in shades of pink and purple appears)
Doofenshmirtz: Huh, it's a...it's a couch. That's a bit anti-climatic, I guess it's a nice couch, though.
(He looks back and forth between his couch and the other one)
Hmm, hey, I got an idea, let's swap my couch for that one! (he enters the portal)
Phineas: Uh...
Doofenshmirtz: (grabs the pink couch and tries to pull it to the portal) Okay, I got it, I got - uh, maybe, hey, you want to give me a hand here?
Phineas: Whoa, awesome! (He and Ferb, who's still holding Perry, enter the portal) Check it out!
Major Monogram (2nd Dimension): Ahem.
Doofenshmirtz: (sees the 2nd dimension Monogram) Oh uh, hello. Say, aren't you...
Phineas: Hey Dr. D! Look at this!
Doofenshmirtz: Hold that thought! (runs over to a balcony and sees Phineas, Ferb, and Perry are looking out)
Phineas: You're famous here!
(reveals the 2nd Dimension Tri-State Area, which is various colors of purples, pinks and greens, we see various places, all named after Doofenshmirtz, we see a 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz poster, he wears a black lab coat buttoned over grey pants and black boots, and grey gloves, he has a goatee, spiked up hair and an eyepatch on his left eye, which has a scar that goes over the patch)
(reveals a large statue of Doofenshmirtz-2, he rides a rhino, holding a shield that reads ME, and holding a sword that reads OBEY)
(reveals a store called Doof's Closet, signs on it read YOUR HOTSPOT FOR MANDATORY DOOFERALLS!, CLOTHES YOU MUST OWN!, HIGH PRICES!, EXPENSIVE!, THE LATEST IN REQUIRED CONFORMITY!)
(A subway train with 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz's face pulls into the station, its doors open)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension) 's VO: Get off!
Doofenshmirtz: (Reading a blimp) "Heinz Doofenshmirtz, Your Leader"?
(Perry has an incredibly nervous look on his face, he gulps)
A whole Tri-State Area where I am already in charge! (chuckles) Yeah! Wait a minute, I gotta go check something out. (he goes up to 2nd Dimension Monogram) Uh, yoo-hoo! Hello again!
Major Monogram (2nd Dimension): Is this some kind of test? Is that really you, sir?
Doofenshmirtz: Ha ha! Holy Boy! Even the great Francis Monogram's my slave in this dimension!
Major Monogram (2nd Dimension): I prefer the term "Indentured Executive Assistant".
Doofenshmirtz: Well, I want to meet this other dimension me, where can I find him?
Major Monogram (2nd Dimension): Oh, you're from another dimension? Well then, he'll probably want to see you, he's into that freaky sorta stuff. Have a seat and I'll let him know you're on your way up.
(He pushes a button on a control and a chair slides in, Doofenshmirtz gets on)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, so I just gotta sit here and...
(it slides away, he screams as two doors open and he enters, a song starts up as he goes into an animatronic ride filled with gnomes, he passes by the Gunther Goat Cheese's Goat and waves)
Gnomes: ♪ Doof Doof Doof♪ / ♪Bask in his glory♪ / ♪Kneel at his feet ♪ /♪ You're in for such a treat♪ / ♪He's Doofenshmirtz!♪
(He enters another room)
Doofenshmirtz: That was awesome! (He slides up to a desk, a chair turns to reveal 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Alright, who's interrupting my...
(He stops and sees Doofenshmirtz, they both Hmm, they get up, switch seats, hmm, and switch seats again, and hmm again)
Do I know you?
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, I'm you from another dimension.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Well that would explain the handsomeness.
Doofenshmirtz: Right back atcha, big guy.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Does that mean you and I are exactly alike?
Doofenshmirtz: I suppose so.

Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Hmm, maybe we're not so much alike
Doofenshmirtz: That can be your catchphrase! You're the grumpy one. (Pokes him) Eh?

(Meanwhile, Perry, Phineas and Ferb are still on the balcony)
Phineas: Wow, he's done really well for himself, what do you think, Perry?
(He holds Perry up, Perry looks around nervously for a second, then reverts to pet mode and chatters)
Hey, where is Dr. D?

(Back in 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz's office)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): So what you're telling me is you're still not ruler of your Tri-State Area?
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah? Well obviously YOU did not have to deal with MY nemesis, Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Oh didn't I? Observe! (He motions to a doorway, it opens, and something steps out)
Doofenshmirtz: What is it?
(reveals 2nd Dimension Perry, or Platyborg, he salutes)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): This is Perry the Platyborg! He was once my nemesis, but now, he is general of my army!
Doofenshmirtz: Wow, you are good!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Dismissed.
(Platyborg salutes again and rockets off)
(Phineas, Ferb, and Perry ride in on the same chairs Doofenshmirtz did)Phineas: That was awesome!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Ugh, now who's interrupting me? Remind me to berate my Indentured Executive Assistant!
Doofenshmirtz: No, no, man, it's cool. They're with me.
Phineas: Hey Dr. D, we thought we lost you.
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, guys! (2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz grabs him) Whoops!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): You dare to bring a secret agent in here?
Doofenshmirtz: This boy's a secret agent?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): No, no, not him!
Doofenshmirtz: The quiet one?
(Ferb turns to Phineas and shrugs)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): No no, HIM!
Doofenshmirtz: This plant?
(reveals a small potted plant next to Phineas, Ferb and Perry)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): The platypus! That's secret agent Perry the Platypus!
Phineas: Whoa whoa, hey, he's just a platypus, he doesn't do much.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Oh, oh this rich, I see what's going on here, you, you really think that he's your pet, don't you? WRONG! He's using you, you're just his cover, he's a secret agent! Here, here, let me prove it. (he looks up) General Platyborg, come down here at once! He'll be here in just a minute, and then...
(Platyborg lands on 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz's foot, he yells in pain and holds his foot, then stops)
Alright Platyborg, you see that platypus? You know what to do.(Platyborg charges and smacks Perry away)
Phineas: Perry!
(Perry lands on his feet and shakes himself)
What was that for?! (He and Ferb run to Perry) Perry, are you okay?
Doofenshmirtz: Told ya!
(Ferb checks Perry with a stethoscope)
Phineas: How are his vitals?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Wait, let me try something. Platyborg, do the same thing to those two boys.
Doofenshmirtz: What?
(Platyborg leaps and charges at Phineas and Ferb)
Phineas: What?
(Platyborg is about to punch, when Perry stands upright and socks him back)
♪ Perry! ♪
Phineas: Perry?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): HA! YES! I knew it!
Doofenshmirtz: Wait, wait a minute, I'm confused, why does their platypus fight so good?
(Perry puts his fedora on)
(gasps) PERRY THE PLATYPUS?!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (sarcastic) Really?
Doofenshmirtz: What?
(2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz groans)
Phineas: Perry?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Get them!
(Two armored bots come at them, Perry pulls Phineas and Ferb away)
Phineas: You're a secret agent?
(They swerve as more bots come in, they slide under the animal skeleton, a bot knocks away the skull)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Hey, be careful with that!
(The skull slides near a window, Phineas, Ferb, and Perry back up. Phineas gets angry)
Phineas: So this is where you disappear to everyday? You come here and fight this guy?
Doofenshmirtz: No no, he fights me, he doesn't really know this guy.
Phineas: You fight a pharmacist? Why would you even do that?!
Doofenshmirtz: Actually, I'm an evil scientist, but a lot of people are confused by the lab coat.
Phineas: You're evil? He's evil?! (They back up to the window pane) So not only have you been leading a double life this whole time, but you sat there and let us help an evil scientist open an evil portal into an evil dimension, and you did nothing to stop us?!
Ferb: Well, he did pee on the couch.
Doofenshmirtz: Wait a second, I just realized, that was a conscious choice! You peed on my couch!
(Perry shrugs embarrassedly)
Phineas: No no, that wasn't enough! That's when you should've put on your little hat, not now, after we've gone forward into this mess!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Oh, for badness sake, you can hash all this out in prison. Guards!
(Perry pushes the brain freeze button on his watch, 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz grabs at his head)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Ahh! Brain freeze!
(Perry opens the window, they fall out. Phineas screams, Perry sticks his foot in the skull's eye sockets and Phineas and Ferb grab the horns, his chute opens up)
♪ Agent P! ♪
Phineas: I-I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble processing this right now. (Perry hands him a pamphlet) "So You've Discovered Your Pet is a Secret Agent..." (throws it away) I don't want your pamphlet!
(Platyborg leaps down after them, wings extend out of his back and he darts to them)
Phineas: Uh oh. (Perry moves them away, Platyborg turns back and flies at them) He's coming back around!
(Perry dislodges the chute as Platyborg cuts through. They land and slide down another window bank. Platyborg rockets back at them. Perry struggles to remove his feet from the skull; Phineas looks.)
Phineas: Oh, you have got to be kidding me! (Perry still struggles) For crying out loud!
(Platyborg rockets back, Phineas and Ferb both try to pull Perry free)
What, they didn't teach you how to get out of this in Spy School?
(Perry is flung, he lands up on the windows and balances himself. Platyborg lands next to him and his wings retract, Perry turns the skull to face him.)
Oh snap! (Perry's discarded parachute lands on them) Look, there's a logo on this parachute! He's got his own logo?
(Perry and Platyborg fight. Perry grabs Platyborg's arm and punches Platyborg's face several times, with no effect. Platyborg smirks evilly and punches Perry, sending him back near the edge. Platyborg morphs his hand into a spinning mace, but Phineas and Ferb wrap him in the parachute. He stumbles and falls off the edge.)
Phineas: All this time, we're like "He's a platypus, he doesn't do much". Well apparently, you do. You... you, you're tangled up in the...
(The skull is caught in the chute lines. Phineas and Ferb grab on, they fall, Platyborg grabs a nearby ledge and Phineas, Ferb, and Perry are flung into a window pane. They all tip as they hit each one, lowering them to the ground.)
Wow, saved by unconventional architecture.
Normbot: (approaches them) May I please see your papers?
(They stare, the Normbot replaces its normal head with an armored one)
(deep voice) Show me your papers or be destroyed.
(The skull lands on the Normbot's head, it sputters and flies off erratically. The door opens and Platyborg comes out, tearing off the chute, he marches up to them, then he hears a noise and looks. The Normbot lands, but right behind him. Platyborg then goes back to marching, but is then hit by a bus. Perry, Phineas, and Ferb run.)
Both Doofenshmirtz's: Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz: Jinx, you owe me a soda!
Normbot: Get me, I'm a Georgia O'Keefe painting!
(A taxi pulls up, Platyborg is stuck on the windshield)
Driver: 4th and Main. (Platyborg gets off and hands him some money) What? No tip? (Platyborg turns his hand into the mace) Never mind, I'm good. (He drives off, Platyborg looks around)

(Phineas, Ferb, and Perry hide in an alley behind a dumpster as several Normbot's hover by, Phineas looks)
Phineas: Looks like they're gone. (Looks at Perry) You're a secret agent?! And you've been living with us this whole time? Was that evil guy right? Were we just your cover story? Were you ever really our pet or part of our family? (Perry looks down, depressed) Apparently not, cause you didn't trust us enough to tell us. Anyone else here leading a bizarre double life? (Ferb raises his hand) Put your hand down, Ferb. (Ferb lowers it) You're a secret agent. He's a secret agent! (Ferb puts a hand on Phineas' shoulder) You're right, Ferb, we have to concentrate on the task at hand, we need to get back to our dimension, and I don't even know where to start.
(Ferb holds up the remote)
Oh, that's right, the remote! (he takes it) I knew that would come in handy! Alright, let's go home!
(He aims the device and opens a portal. We see a pastel colored forest area with a weird, six eyed lizard type creature.)
Wait, that's not our dimension.
(He shuts the portal, taps the remote and opens and closes portals in different spots, each has the same image)
Nope. Uh uh. Not that one. Great, now this thing's broken. We're gonna need some help. I know! Let's go find us!
(They peek behind the dumpster, Phineas looks at Perry)
Phineas: Wait a minute, I just realized, you could've been cleaning your own litter box this whole time! (Perry shrugs) Oh we are not done with this conversation! (They run off)

(Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz is squeezed into a small school chair. 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz is by a picture of Perry in pet mode.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): So tell me, other-dimension me. What do you see here?
Doofenshmirtz: An ordinary platypus.
(2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz flips the page, now showing an image of Perry in secret agent mode.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): And now what do you see?
Doofenshmirtz: (gasps) Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz-2: You know, I'm starting to see why you haven't become ruler in your dimension.
Doofenshmirtz: Alright, Mr. "Eviler than Thou", how did you manage to take over the Tri-State Area, anyway?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Simple, I used an army of big, scary robots.
(Motions to a huge army of Normbots, they convert to the Norm heads)
Normbots: We should do lunch sometime! (they revert back to the armored heads)
Doofenshmirtz: Wow, that is scary. I tried that robot thing once, too. I hid the self-destruct button on the bottoms of their feet, so nobody could reach them.

(Flashback to Doofenshmirtz with his army of bots, all which have the foot with the self destruct button raised up, he rides on the shoulder of one of the bots. Doofenshmirtz then calls out "And march", which causes the robots to take a step forward and explode)

(Present)
Doofenshmirtz: I think I've said enough. I still don't get it, if we're the same person, how come you're so much better at being evil than me?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): True evil is born through pain and loss. You see, when I was a small boy back in Gimmelshtump, I had a toy train.

(We flashback to young Doofenshmirtz-2, still with the eyepatch, but no scar. He holds a wooden train, we then see him looking at the tracks.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (narrating) Then one day, I lost it.
Young Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Choo Choo?

(Present; Doofenshmirtz stares)
Doofenshmirtz: That's... That's it?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): What do you mean?
Doofenshmirtz: That's your emotionally scarring backstory? That's your great tragedy? Dude, I was raised by ocelots, literally. Disowned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats, and you're telling me you lost a toy train? That's it? That's all you got? Really? I had to work as a lawn gnome, I was forced to wear hand-me-up girl's clothing, neither of my parents showed up for my birth!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Well, how did you feel when you lost that toy train?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, I never lost that toy train.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Well, maybe if you had, you would've done better. Since you have neglected to take over YOUR Tri-State Area, I think I'll go over there and give it a shot myself.
Doofenshmirtz: Great, we can be a team!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (Sarcastic) Yeah, right, a team.
Doofenshmirtz: Wait, was that sarcasm?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (Sarcastic) No...
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, right there, I'm pretty sure that's my voice when I'm being sarcastic.

(At 1st Dimension, Candace, Stacy, Isabella, and Baljeet walk up to Buford, who is on a park bench, chewing some gum)
Candace: Okay Buford, where are Phineas and Ferb?
Buford: How should I know? They never showed up for me to return serve. That's considered a forfeit in catapult badminton, so I went to get some Victory Gum.
♪Victory Gum!♪
Buford: A tradition as old as the game itself.
Candace: Don't play with me, young man, where is the giant platypult they built?
Buford: Don't know, it seems to have vanished.
Candace: Oh really? Did you hear that, Stace? The mysterious force took the platypult away before I, the grown up, could see it.
Stacy: Yeah yeah, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for all of this.

(We cut to the tow truck driver from before towing the Platypult)
Driver: And they laughed at me for installing a platypult tow rig. Who's laughing now, Wayne?
(Back to the park)
Candace: The logical explanation IS the mysterious force, the question is, why does it care so much about my little brothers? Why doesn't it want them to get busted?
Buford: Well, why don't you ask it, Kierkegaard? (They stare) What? Existentialist Trading Cards. (Holds up a pack) Came with the gum.
Candace: Wait, he's right! I should just ask it, I'll bet I can reason with it.
Stacy: Reason with it? Candace, it's a force, that you made up.
Candace: No, I know what I'm talking about, Stacy, Come on! (Pulls her)
Stacy: Where are we going?
Candace: To my backyard, the heart of the mysterious force!
(The kids look, Baljeet then pulls out two cards)
Baljeet: Would you like to trade two Sartre for a Nietzsche?
Buford: Alright. (He takes the cards and hands the other over)
Baljeet: Sucker.

(At the 2nd Dimension, a pair of Normbots hover by two trash cans. After they go, Phineas and Ferb poke their heads out of them)
Phineas: Well, this should be our street, but it sure looks different.
(They pop out of the cans and run, Perry following, we then see 2nd Dimension Lawrence walk out of his house, Phineas and Ferb poke out of the bushes)
Dad?
Lawrence (2nd Dimension): Boys, what are you doing here? You'd better get inside before the Doofbot catches you. I'm off to the factory. See you next week!
(He holds up a hook, which is attached to a harness he is wearing. A bus passes, hooking him on, along with several other people, then it drives off.)
Phineas: Wow, well I guess we'd better get inside. (He is about to ring the doorbell when Perry walks up, Phineas looks) Uh, you might want to... Uh, I mean these guys might not know that you're not really a... you know...
(Perry looks down and realizes. He smiles sheepishly, reverts to pet mode, and then chatters)
(Phineas and Ferb stare at him. Phineas rings the bell, they stare again for a second)
Linda (2nd Dimension): (opens the door) Boys, I thought you were in your room! Get back inside and get your Dooferalls back on before someone sees you, if you need me, I'll be hiding in the basement.
Phineas: That was weird. Let's find the other us.

(We see a hand spin a Doofopoly spinner)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): And....hey, I got a one! Pick a Doofopoly instruction card. (reads) "Conform", hey, I can do that!
Phineas: (walks in) Hey guys!
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Oh no, they're replacing us! (he hides behind the couch) I must not have conformed quick enough!
Phineas: No no, it's not like that, we're you guys from another dimension.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): A different dimension? Is that allowed?
Phineas: Apparently.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Oh look! Perry's back! (he runs up and hugs Perry) Where have you been? We missed you so much!
Phineas: Uh, Phineas, he's not your Perry, he came with us.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Oh, sorry. (he reaches to hand him back, then stops) Wait, can I hold him a little longer?
(He hugs Perry again, Ferb and 2nd Dimension Ferb's eyes water and and they both pull out handkerchiefs)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): (hands Perry back) It's just, well, he left one day and never came back. He's been gone for a long time and I'm really worried.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Alright, you know the only time we're allowed to make noise is on Doofens Day, so keep it... (looks and turns around) Are there four of you in this room?
Phineas: Five counting Perry.
Candace (2nd Dimension): I see nothing, I have plausible deniability. (She walks off)
Phineas: Boy, your Candace is much less curious about you're up to.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): What do you mean?
Phineas: Well, it seems like our Candace has spent her entire summer focused on what we're doing.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Summer? I think that was outlawed a long time ago.
Phineas: You guys don't have summer? Well that's-that's terrible.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Summer... It sounds dangerous, yet oddly compelling. What is it?
Phineas: What is summer? Man, where do I begin?

Phineas: ♪The days are longer, The nights are shorter, The sun is shining♪

Phineas: (still talking) ...And then we launched ourselves from a giant Perry the Platypult... (he sees Perry sneaking off)
(Perry hides behind a curtain and puts on his fedora, he is about to go)
You're kidding me! (Perry stops) You're actually sneaking away again? So nothing's changed, huh? Did it ever occur to you that we could help you? That we could've made a great team? But I guess you can't have teamwork without trust.

You don't need to sneak away anymore, we know your secret, you can just go.

Phineas: You know, I used to think you couldn't spell "platypus" without "us". (walks back inside)
Ferb: Well you can, but it would just be "Platyp". (he shuts the door)
Phineas: Well, I guess if you guys can't help us fix the remote, we could check with Isabella.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Who's Isabella?
Phineas: The girl who lives across the street.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Mom says that talking to neighbors can be dangerous.

Phineas (2nd Dimension): What about the Normbots?
(They sneak out)
Phineas: Relax, we've been avoiding them all day, if you're really careful, you can... (they stop in front of a Normbot) Okay, we got to be more careful than that.
Normbot: (Norm Head) May I please see your identification?
Phineas: Uh....
Normbot: (switches to Armored Head) Display your travel papers or be destroyed, display-display...
(It sparks and shudders, then collapses, reveals 2nd Dimension Buford on its back, pulling out wires)
Buford (2nd Dimension): I can't stand these things!
Phineas: Hey, it's Buford!
Buford (2nd Dimension): Do I know you guys?
Phineas: We're Candace's brothers, we're going to Isabella's.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Are you part of the Resistance?
Buford (2nd Dimension): I used to be in the resistance, but I got so good at it, that I started resisting them.

(We cut to Doofenshmirtz and 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz with the Other-Dimensionator)
Doofenshmirtz: Behold, the Other-Dimensionator! Well actually, this is the Other Other-Dimensionator, the Other-Dimensionator is back in the other dimension. (2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz glares) Okay, step 1 is push this button, (pushes it, it powers up) and step 2, stand back in awe! (it starts up, but then shuts down) Awww...
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): That's it?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, now that I think about it, those two boys made some modifications to my design which may have allowed to, you know, to work.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Great, now I need those two boys?
(Just then, a Normbot comes in, holding Perry. It throws him, a wastebasket is put on top of him, and a brick is placed on top of it.)
Both Doofenshmirtz's: Ah, Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz: Jinx, you owe me TWO sodas!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Listen, Perry the Platypus, I know I said if you turned yourself in, I wouldn't hurt your friends, but change of plans, now I need to hunt them down, which may involve a little hurting, I know that makes me a liar, but hello! Evil! (Perry glares)

(Meanwhile, 2nd Dimension Buford opens the gate to Isabella's house, they walk in)
Buford (2nd Dimension): Isabella's house is right over...
(Just then, a trap door opens under them, they scream as they fall down, and a group of shadowed figures tie them up, we see it's the Firestorm Girls (2nd Dimension Fireside Girls) and 2nd Dimension Isabella)
Isabella (2nd Dimension): (tough voice) What'cha doin'?
Phineas: Isabella?
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Do I know you?
Buford (2nd Dimension): Hey, Isabella!
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Ugh, him I know. Buford, what do you want? I thought you were resisting us?
Buford (2nd Dimension): I was helping Candace's brothers cross the street.
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Candace has two sets of twin brothers?
Phineas: Uh no, he and I are from another dimension, we're trying to get back.
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Alright girls, release them.
(the Firestorm Girls pull on the ropes, untying them, they emerge in a pose, then collapse, a door opens, revealing a computer area)
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Why would you want to come to this dimension anyway?
Phineas: Well, we didn't mean to come here, and now we can't go back unless we fix this device. (shows the remote)
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Well, we may have someone who can help you. Dr. Baljeet!
(A chair turns, revealing 2nd Dimension Baljeet)
Phineas: Baljeet!
Baljeet (2nd Dimension): That's Dr. Baljeet to you. Were you not listening? Here is the crux of your problem. Think of the universe and all of the many dimensions as circular. The energy flows between the dimensions like this, clockwise. Say that this is your dimension, and this is our dimension, you traveled with the flow of energy, so going clockwise would be easy. Going counterclockwise would take 8 million gigawatts of energy, overloading the local power grid. I have prepared a little song to help illustrate my point, (he plays an accordion)
(Song: Baljeet Explanation)
♪ If you travel through dimensions, going clockwise makes it easy, going counter-clockwise would take 8 million gigawatt's of energy, overloading the local power grid! ♪
(pauses) I know, it needs a chorus. Anyway, without 8 million gigawatts, you would have to go clockwise, the long way around. Theoretically, you would get home, but there is no telling how many dimensions you would have to go through.
Phineas: Well do you think you can get enough power to open the portal backwards so we can get home?
Baljeet (2nd Dimension): Well, we should probably ask our leader...
Candace (2nd Dimension): (in deep voice) Ask your leader what?
(We see what looks like the silhouette of a tall, muscular man, we hear coughing, and reveals Candace-2 showing the silhouette was a bush)
(deep voice) Who made the topiary out of wild parsnips? I'm allergic, and it's messing up my voice!
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Candace, you're the leader of the Resistance?
Candace (2nd Dimension): (deep voice) What are you two- (coughs, normal voice) -doing here? Never mind, I'll deal with you later. (walks up to Phineas and Ferb) You two! I've been spending all these years trying to keep my brothers safe, and suddenly their faces are all over the Doofen Channel!
Phineas: We're just trying to get home.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Well, what's stopping you?
Phineas: Right now? Quantum Physics.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Baljeet?
Baljeet (2nd Dimension): We need to generate 8 million gigawatts for inter-dimensional travel.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Then we've got work to do, Isabella, start redirecting the power.
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Aye, aye!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Gretchen, monitor the Doofen Channel. Make sure we're not raising any alarms.
Gretchen (2nd Dimension): I'm on it.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Buford, keep resisting.
Buford (2nd Dimension): No!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Excellent. (deep voice) And will somebody get rid of that topiary?
(Katie (2nd Dimension) and Ginger (2nd Dimension) lower down and pull it away, she coughs, normal voice) Thank you.

(At 1st Dimension Flynn-Fletcher backyard, Candace and Stacy are there)
Candace: Oh, great and powerful Mysterious Force. I know you are just trying to protect my brothers, but I am just trying to protect them too from their dangerous inventions. Show yourself so that I may reason with you! (nothing happens) Maybe we should build a shrine to it.
Stacy: Candace, that's ridic... (the dimensional portal opens up)
Both: Ah! It's the mysterious force! (hides behind a tree)

Candace: And why are we in mine cars?
Isabella (2nd Dimension): This will take us as far as the underground entrance to his headquarters.
Candace (2nd Dimension): (showing a map) From there, we go up the ventilation shaft, the detainment center is on Level 4.
Buford (2nd Dimension): And the snack bar is on Level 5! (2nd Dimension Candace glares) If there's time!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Ugh, Buford. (Puts away the map)
Buford (2nd Dimension): I'm just gonna get some nachos.
(2nd Dimension Candace leaps up the cars and uses a Bo staff to hit a turnstile, the tracks move, and the go down another route, 2nd Dimension Candace sits near Candace)
Candace: So if there's another me, and another them, then there must also be another Jeremy Johnson here, right?
Candace (2nd Dimension): Huh? Oh yeah, Johnson Jeremy, leads a three-man strike team on the north side. Good soldier.
Candace: Good soldier? That's all you think of him? Don't you think he's dreamy, or cool, or even cute? Tell me at least you think he's cute!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Cute doesn't win the war, kid.
Candace: Oh... well I guess, but what do you guys do around here for, you know, fun?
Candace (2nd Dimension): Look, Candace is it? No offense, but fun isn't really on my agenda. You know, since Doofenshmirtz took over the Tri-State Area, even though I was a little girl, I've been focused on one thing, and one thing only, he's going down, down, down...
Candace: Down, I know, but what about BFF's, or slumber parties, or busting your little brothers?
Candace (2nd Dimension): Busting my brothers? I've spent every day of my life trying to protect my little brothers. I had to grow up pretty quick to make sure they didn't have to.
Candace: Gee, you make growing up sound like it's a bad thing.
Candace (2nd Dimension): It is what it is, I'll do whatever I have to do to protect the ones I love.
(2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb appear behind them)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Aww, thanks, sis!
Candace (2nd Dimension): What are you guys doing here?
Phineas (2nd Dimension): We want to help.
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Sir, we're nearing the target.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Ugh! (to 2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb) Don't move!
(she leaps into the forward car and uses her staff to jam the wheels just as they reach an entry way, they all get out)
Okay people, change of plans, this is as far as we go.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): We're not gonna help them?
Candace (2nd Dimension): No, we're going to get you two home where it's safe.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): But we want to...
Candace (2nd Dimension): Look, this isn't our fight, it's theirs, and you two shouldn't have gotten involved!
(she hits a button and a door opens)
Maybe none of us should have. Okay, we're outta here.
(2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb get into the cars and she pushes it back. 2nd Dimension Isabella and 2nd Dimension Buford follow the others into the doorway.)
Buford (2nd Dimension): I don't remember it being so dark down here.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Dark?
(The lights come on, revealing Normbots surrounding them)
Doofenshmirtz: That's because it's a trap!
(laughs as he comes out with 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz, who is holding Perry by a collar chain)
And if it was light, you would've seen us and run away, hence ruining the trap!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): I think they get that.
Phineas: Perry! We uh, well... well, we uh, came to rescue you! (pause) So far it's not going as well as we'd hoped. We didn't have time to, you know, plan something elaborate, but we could've, I don't know, created some sort of diversion, just in case... (sighs) Yeah, we could've thought this out more.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (laughs) I got you, and I got your little friends, too. Game over. You lose! I win! Mark this the hour of your doom, Perry the Platypus! (checks his watch) Three-forty...ugh, I got one of these watches with just the little hash marks on it. It doesn't even have numbers on it! Let's just say it's between 3:30 and 4:00, Eastern Standard Time.
(Perry's eyes widen in realization, he pushes a button on his watch, showing a hologram of Major Monogram showering. He yelps and covers himself. Both Doofenshmirtz's turn away in disgust, as do Platyborg and the Normbots. 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz lets go of Perry's chain, and he runs, still having the hologram on.)
Major Monogram: (holograph) I told you, not between 3:30 and 4:00!
(Perry goes up to Phineas and Ferb, who also have their eyes closed and grabs them, pulling them away)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): They're getting away!
(They run out the door as the Normbots chase them. 2nd Dimension Candace hits the button, shutting the door, and an alarm sound goes off.)
Candace (2nd Dimension): I knew this was a bad idea. Okay, everyone in the cars!
(they all hop in, and she pushes) Go go go! Isabella, start the motor!
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Yes sir!
(she leaps to the front as the Normbots melt through the door)
I got it!
(she starts it as the bots chase them)
(Phineas and Ferb pull 2nd Dimension Candace in)
Candace (2nd Dimension): (to 2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb) You two, keep your heads down and remember your training!
Phineas (2nd Dimension): But we never had any training!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Well, keep your heads down! (they duck) Consider yourselves trained.
(the Normbots approach) This is going to be close. (she picks up her staff and twirls it) All right, you rust buckets, let's dance.
(she smashes away several as Phineas, Ferb, Perry and Candace watch)
Phineas: (to Candace) Uh, can you do that?
Candace: Apparently...
(2nd Dimension Candace sinks her staff into the neck of one bot. She uses it to vault and hit another, then rips the head off the first bot. 2nd Dimension Buford stares wide eyed.)
Buford (2nd Dimension): I am so in love with her right now.
Isabella (2nd Dimension): What?
Buford (2nd Dimension): Nothing!
Candace (2nd Dimension): If we can get to the north tunnel before they get to us, I can trip the security door. (Perry pulls his collar off his neck) Isabella, give us more throttle!
Isabella (2nd Dimension): It's all the way in, sir!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Alright, hang tough, this is going to get hairy. (She leaps away. Perry wields his collar and chain as a weapon, Phineas picks up a wrench and Ferb takes off his shoes and ties the laces together to make nun-chucks.)
(2nd Dimension Candace leaps to the front)
Isabella (2nd Dimension): Can we make those turns at this speed?
Candace (2nd Dimension): Well we're about to find out! (she uses her staff to hit the turnstile, they swerve)
(Perry wraps his chain around one of the Normbots' arms and attaches the collar to a sign, causing the chain to rip the arm off. It lands in the car where 2nd Dimension Buford and Candace are, and its laser fires, setting fire to it; they back up.)
Buford (2nd Dimension): Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(Candace screams, they go through a tunnel and approach an entryway)
Candace (2nd Dimension): There it is. We should be okay if we can just hold off these...
(The bots are hit with lasers, she looks and sees Phineas, Ferb, and Perry using the robot arm as a laser cannon.)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Can we do that?
Candace (2nd Dimension): No, keep your head down.
(2nd Dimension Phineas ducks back down)
(Platyborg flies down; his hands turn to lasers and he fires, hitting two of the wheels. The car skids.)
Phineas: (drops the ammo) No, no, no...!
Isabella (2nd Dimension): We're slowing down, sir!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Keep it on the floor.
Isabella (2nd Dimension): It's on the floor! (looks) There's too much track. I don't think we're gonna make it!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Everyone to the front car. We're going to have to cut loose these cars...
(Flames shoot up, blocking Candace, Perry, Phineas, and Ferb)
Isabella (2nd Dimension): The motor's overheating!
(2nd Dimension Candace looks at Phineas, Ferb, Candace, and Perry, then to 2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb, she looks)
Candace (2nd Dimension): Sorry guys, you're on your own.
(She hits the lock with her staff, causing the cars to dislodge. She opens the doorway as they go in and it seals up again.)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): What are you doing?
Candace (2nd Dimension): My job, protecting you two.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): We have to go back and help them!
Candace (2nd Dimension): That's not our fight.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): But we could've made it. We could've all made it!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Or we could've all been captured, and I couldn't let that happen. These are the tough choices, people, someone has to be the adult here. You guys are safe, and that's what matters.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): But-but-but...
Candace (2nd Dimension): End of discussion.
(2nd Dimension Phineas looks down sadly)
Buford (2nd Dimension): Man, I had my heart set on those nachos.

(1st dimension, Stacy has a display table set up)
Stacy: Uh, mysterious force. I feel a little awkward talking to you, because I didn't believe in you at first. Because lets face it, it's crazy, but then I saw you eat my friend, so, I've made a little shrine here. It's...It's nice, there's a banana, and, uh, oh, Mr. Miggins! So, I hope this makes up for the disbelief thing. Are we, uh, are we good?

(2nd dimension, DEI. 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz talks to Phineas and Ferb, who are held by Normbots.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Now you have no choice but to fix my machine!
Phineas: No.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): That's not one of your choices. Fix my machine!
Phineas: No.
Candace: Can, uh, can I say something? So I think I'm up to date on the whole Perry-agent thing. Strangely, that's the most normal thing that's happened this afternoon... But who exactly is this guy?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Fix it!
Phineas: No.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Look, I would make myself do it, but apparently, he's an idiot.
Doofenshmirtz: Hey!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Fix the machine!
Phineas: No.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Very well then. You've forced my hand! (he pulls out a dog sock puppet)
(high pitched voice) Fix the machine!
Phineas: No.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Really? When I was your age, I did anything a puppet told me to do!
Phineas: How old do you think we are?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): I don't know, one, two? It's hard to tell with the one eye. Anyway, I don't know why you're being so uncooperative. All I'm asking you to do is make my machine work so I can invade and conquer your world and enslave your loved ones.
Phineas: See, that's just it. Why would we do something that would lead to our own self-destruction?
(Doofenshmirtz hears this, his eyes widen in realization)
Doofenshmirtz: Self-destruction? Self-destruct... Wait, wait! I remember now! They took out my self-destruct button! (he pulls it out) I don't know why I put it back in, but here, I'll just rewire this, like so, and there! (he clips in a wire and turns it on, it forms a portal) It's working! It's working! It is functioning properly!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (smirks at Phineas) Well well, look who just became redundant! Send them to their doom! (Platyborg points to Candace) Yes, her too. (He points to Perry) Yes yes, everyone. Doom, doom, doom, and...
Both Doofenshmirtz's: Doom!
Doofenshmirtz: Jinx, you owe me THREE sodas!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Okay, doom for him, too.
Doofenshmirtz: What? But, but I'm you!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (sticks out the puppet) Doom!
Doofenshmirtz: Wow, if I had a nickel for every time I was doomed by a puppet, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?

(We then cut to the same lava pit we started the movie off in. Phineas, Perry, Candace, Ferb, and Doofenshmirtz are chained and led by Normbots. 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz appears on screen.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Welcome, doomed guests. Come on. Keep trudging. Doom is that away!
(they approach a large covered item)
Candace: I would say so far, adulthood gets a three.
Doofenshmirtz: You know, this may be as good as it gets. (they walk onto a rocky area)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): And now for my all-time favorite game...
(the tarp is pulled off the item, revealing a cage holding the Goozim; it roars)
Poke the Goozim with a stick, surrounded by lava. (the pathway retracts) My second favorite game is backgammon, love it!
Doofenshmirtz: Wait, wait, hold the phone. I can be useful. What if you need a kidney? Or a stand-in for boring functions you have to attend, or another kidney?
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Doom!
Doofenshmirtz: Aw, pooh.
(Several Normbots poke the Goozim with spears. It roars, blowing their hair back. Another bot turns a crank, opening the cage.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Cranky, cranky, cranky. Oh, I love the crank!
(It roars again)
Phineas: I'll be honest, Ferb. I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this. Blah blah blah, two-car garage, etcetera, etcetera.
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, well, welcome to MY life! (The Goozim roars. He hides behind a Normbot.)
Ferb: Whoa, déjà vu-ish.
(Perry bites at his cuffs. A Normbot passes by.)
Phineas: Hey, Perry. Check out that guard! (we see a ring of keys on a hook on his back) The keys!
(Perry looks down at the keyhole on his collar and moves his cuff to reveal the watch. He activates the electro-magnet and fires, pulling the keys to them.)
Phineas: Cool! (see the Normbot is also being pulled to them) Ah! Look out!
(It hits into them, and flies erratically. Ferb climbs on its back and opens a panel, which hits Doofenshmirtz on the head.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ow! Is this the plan? (they fly into the air and over the lava, he screams) Please tell me this isn't the plan!
(Ferb works with the Normbot's wiring)
Normbot: You are tampering with the property of... (he sparks and turns to the Norm head) Let's make omelets!
(It flies and hits into two Normbots. The Goozim grabs them and shreds them. Doofenshmirtz screams as they fly; he hits the head of the Normbot turning the crank, knocking it off.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ow! Can you get a little more lift on this thing? I think I just bruised a kidney.
Normbot: My bicycle is missing!
(The Normbots smash into each other, destroying them. They fall onto the top of the cage, the Goozim looks up. The headless Normbot holding the crank collapses, the crank spins and shuts the cage.)
All: Yay! (the door then breaks off and falls down) Awww.
(The Goozim wedges itself out of the cage. It grabs the door in its teeth and throws it.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Ha, ha! Yes! Go, Goozim!
(A Normbot comes in wearing an apron and oven mitts, he holds a muffin on a tray)
Normbot: It's muffin time, sir.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Already?
(It turns, Perry looks wide eyed and frantically tries to unlock his chains. The Goozim roars, they scream and tumble together. The keys drop, landing on the bottom of the cage. Perry looks, he then looks up and points to the edge of the cage. He begins to climb down it.)
Phineas: Okay, I see where you're going with this. (They all climb)
Candace: I officially prefer our dimension.
(Perry reaches the bottom and moves to the keys, the others following)
Doofenshmirtz: Uh, this may not be the best time to tell you, but I actually flunked jungle gym in grade school. I just couldn't get the hang of all that climbing and...
(The Goozim roars and swipes. He yells and falls, taking the others with him. Perry grabs the bar, the keys shake and fall, but Candace accidentally catches them. Perry holds on. Doofenshmirtz sees the keys.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh great, you caught it! Quick, unlock me!
Candace: Are you even paying attention?
(Doofenshmirtz looks down, seeing he is hanging directly over the lava)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, that's right. Uh, it can wait, later.
(Perry struggles to hang on, the Goozim roars. 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz, eating some muffins, turns back and sees, he spits.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): More guards!
(The Normbot comes back with a tray full of muffins)
Normbot: It's muffin time, sir!
Doofenshmirtz-2: You're broken! (hits him with a muffin)
(More Normbots swarm out, the Goozim roars and swipes. Phineas gulps, he hears a rumbling noise, he looks and sees one of the large lawn gnomes move.)
(It hits the screen, causing cracks, we see 2nd Dimension Candace is behind it, pushing with her feet. The gnome tips over and she rides it, she unhooks two devices from her belt. One fires a grappler, which ties onto a bar on the ceiling, the other she places on the back of the gnome. It shoots a grapple which shoots and hooks onto the front of the gnome, she hooks the two together and the gnome swings, smashing into the Normbots.)
Phineas: Yay, other dimension Candace!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Phineas, catch!
(She pulls out the remote and throws it. He catches it, he sees and gasps.)
Phineas: The remote!
(More bots swarm in; he looks down at the lava, his eyes widen, then looks up)
Perry, let go!
(Perry looks surprised)
Candace: What? No, don't let go!
Phineas: Perry, trust me!
Candace: Two words: La-va! (Perry struggles)
Phineas: Trust me!
(Perry looks, he lets go and they fall. The Normbots crash into each other, the Goozim roars and dives after them. Phineas aims the remote and opens a portal in the lava. They fall in and the Goozim squeezes in after them.)
(They land in the pinkish jungle of the other dimension and bounce around on the plants. They land on the ground and the Goozim lands, now compressed into a circular shape. He growls, but then sees his body, he whimpers and slinks off. Candace smirks and holds up the keys.)

(Back in the 2nd dimension)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): They opened another portal! Get after them!
(Normbots fly down, Candace-2 yells as she swings by on the gnome)
And her, that banshee screaming girl. Get her too! (bots fly after her)

(In the other dimension, the others are unlocked. Perry unlocks Doofenshmirtz.)
Doofenshmirtz: Thank you, Perry the Platypus.
(Lasers fire, they look; Normbots pour through the portal.)
Normbot: Stop where you are. You cannot leave.
2nd Normbot: (Norm head) I use aggression to mask my insecurities! (he turns to the armored head and fires, Phineas dodges)
Phineas: The portal! (he shuts it, the other bots hit the lava and melt)
Normbot: (melting) (falling into lava) Wow, I could go for a (slightly muffled voice) lemonade!
(two Normbots hold a struggling 2nd Dimension Candace)
Normbot: The portal closed, sir.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Oh pooh. Oh well, time to start the invasion! (he goes, the bots follow) And somebody get me a muffin!
(the muffin Normbot follows, now carrying two trays filled with muffins)
Normbot: But it's not muffin time, sir!

(Other dimension, the others run from the bots)
Phineas: Alright, follow me. We're going around clockwise!
(he aims the remote and fires, opening a portal and they leap through, the bots follow)
(as the song goes on, they go into different dimensions)

(1st dimension, the kids are still in the park)
Buford: Alright, how about two Kafka's for your Dostoevsky?
Baljeet: Stop wasting my time, Buford.
(the portal opens and the others emerge)
Phineas: Wait, I think this is it.
Isabella: Where have you guys been?
Phineas: This is it.

(DEI, the roof opens; 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz laughs evilly)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): I spy with my one little eye, a new Tri-State Area that's one dictator short of a dictatorship. (he pushes a button and the Other-Dimensionator rises on a platform) Well, that's all about to change, pretty soon I'll be ruling over two Tri-State Area's, a virtual Six-State Area!
(He hits a button with a Normbot picture on it, 2nd dimension, the Normbots fly to the Other Dimensionator portal)
Fly, fly, my Normbots! We've got some oppressing to do! (he laughs as they emerge)

(Park)
Baljeet: Uh, why is Perry wearing a hat?
Phineas: We don't have time to explain, we've got to try and stop an evil d...
(they see thousands upon thousands of Normbots spill out of the portal)
Candace: Oh no, it's too late!

(Danville city streets, a woman talks to a man)
Woman #1: They're never going to fire her, and... (there is a flash) Hey, did you see that?
Man #1: No, I... (he turns and gasps) What's going on?
Old Woman: Oh my!
Woman #2: What is it?
Man #2: It's a comb over, I know, I should really just shave it!
(The bots swarm down)
Man #3: Not happening. Not happening!
Woman #3: My watermelon!
(The Normbots patrol the city, people run and scream)
Normbot: All vehicles must stop. (It grabs a car and throws it, it impacts into a wall)
Man #4: It's okay, it's a rental!
(the Love Händel tour bus drives through the streets, Danny honks the horn, a Normbot blasts the bus, it flips on its side, they open the doors and look out)
Danny: Oh great, Albuquerque '93 all over again.
(Sherman ducks as a laser is fired)

(Park)
Phineas: I wish alternate dimension Candace was here, she took out like thirty of those guys with a lawn gnome.
(While he talks, Perry's watch flashes. He answers, projecting Monogram's head.)
Major Monogram: Agent P, our agents are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of robots coming into our dimension. You must get to Doof's headquarters and stop him!
Phineas: Aye aye, sir! We're ready to serve!
Major Monogram: Oh no, you kids need to go home, where it's safe!
Phineas: With all due respect, sir, we've been through quite a lot together. We're a team now.
Major Monogram: Nope, far too dangerous, and besides, our insurance won't cover it. Tell 'em Agent P.
Phineas: Come on, Perry. Let's go kick some robot chassis!
(Perry takes off his collar and hands it to them) Perry? (Perry salutes and runs off) Wow, I guess we're going home then. Hey, where's Dr. D?

(DEI: Doofenshmirtz runs to the front door. He pats himself down and then pulls on the door. It's locked, he pushes a button on the intercom.)
Mrs. Thompson: Hello?
Doofenshmirtz: Hello, Mrs. Thompson. It's me, Heinz. I think I left my keys in the other dimension. Can you buzz me in?
Mrs. Thompson: Who is this?
Doofenshmirtz: Heinz Doofenshmirtz, your neighbor, for like 12 years.
Mrs. Thompson: Who?
Doofenshmirtz: I live in the penthouse. I wear lab coats a lot. Speak with the accent I am currently speaking to you with.
Mrs. Thompson: Just like my neighbor upstairs.
Doofenshmirtz: Yes, exactly!
Mrs. Thompson: Oh, he's not home. You'll have to come back later.
Doofenshmirtz: No no no, wait... (she hangs up) Aww!

(2nd dimension: 2nd Dimension Candace is in a cell, bouncing a ball against a wall)
Candace (2nd Dimension): This is just beautiful. I decide to do the right thing, and I end up in a cell. (she looks out the barred window) Well, at least my brothers are safe... (she lays on the cot and bounces the ball) What lesson am I supposed to be learning here?
(she hears a noise, the lock on the door is cut out and the door opens, we see 2nd Dimension Jeremy)
Jeremy (2nd Dimension): I'm Jeremy Johnson. I'm here to rescue you.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Johnson, Jeremy?
Jeremy (2nd Dimension): (saluting) Yes sir, and I also picked up a couple new recruits.
(We see 2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb in commando style gear)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): We figured out a way to bypass the entire security grid, it was cool!
Candace (2nd Dimension): What? You brought my little brothers? Are you out of your mind, soldier?
Jeremy (2nd Dimension): I didn't know they were your brothers, but I should've known. They're smart and courageous, just like you.
Candace (2nd Dimension): You think I'm smart and courageous?
Jeremy (2nd Dimension): Well, yeah. Uh, sir.
Candace (2nd Dimension): Uh, good work, soldier.
Jeremy (2nd Dimension): We should probably get out of here while we can.
(he hands her a pair of sunglasses) Most of the Normbots are away in the other dimension, we can slip away pretty easily.
Candace (2nd Dimension): The Normbots are in the other dimension? This isn't the time to escape. This is the time to make our move! (she puts on the glasses) Let's go!
Jeremy and Phineas (both 2nd Dimension): Yes sir! (they head out)
Candace (2nd Dimension): Boys, wait! Thanks for rescuing me. I'm really proud of you both. (they hug)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): And we're proud of you too... Sir.
Buford (2nd Dimension): I got nachos! Who wants some? (they stare) Nobody?

(1st dimension: Stacy is on her knees next to the altar)
Stacy: Oh, mysterious force. You can see I'm really trying here. Please bring back Candace!
Candace: Oh, hi Stacy.
(Stacy turns and sees Candace is right next to her)
Stacy: And I also want a car!

(Phineas and Ferb's house)
Phineas: I still can't believe Perry wanted us to go home. I mean, look at this!
(he motions to a mini TV, a news report is on)
Reporter: There's robots all over the Tri-State Area! And now for the weather.
(they cut to a man on the street in the middle of the swarm, holding an umbrella)
Weatherman: There's robots, Phil, ROBOTS! (he screams and runs)
Phineas: You'd think he'd need all the help he can... (He hears a beeping sound) Wait, what's that? Ferb, do you hear that?
(he reaches into his pocket, pulling out the locket, which is what is beeping) It's Perry's locket!
(they walk up to the couch, the beeping intensifies) Oh, it's like a homing device.
(they climb up to the mirror, the beep gets higher, the beeps get to its fastest, Ferb removes the mirror, revealing the tunnel, Phineas smiles)
Shall we?
(Ferb motions to Phineas, they get sucked in and land in Perry's lair)
This must be Perry's lair.
Computer: (Female voice) Welcome, Phineas and Ferb. Please insert the key.
Phineas: (to Ferb) Do you have a key? (Ferb takes out a pitch pipe and blows a note)
Computer: Please insert the key.
Phineas: Good try.
Computer: Please insert the key. Please insert the key. (it points down, showing a keyhole shaped like Perry's unfolded locket)
Phineas: That's odd, it's a shaped keyhole, it kinda looks like—wait a minute!
(He pulls out the locket and tears off the collar. He puts it on the keyhole, unfolds it, and pushes down. The hole glows red and shines. There is a beeping sound.)
Computer: Phineas and Ferb, this message is top secret, for your ears only. If you're hearing this, the Tri-State Area is at alert level Alpha Red. Agent P needs your help.
Phineas: How does he know we'll know what to do?
Computer: He knows you will know what to do. He also knows you are the only ones capable of helping him, because you two are the only ones capable of creating these.
(A wall opens, they look)
Voice: Auto scan replication initiated.
(A device shoots out red beams of light, recreating many of Phineas and Ferb’s inventions from past episodes of the series, such as the treehouse robots, The Beak armor and Rover)
Phineas: Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today!

(The Normbots fly through the city. One fires a laser, blasting off the Tri-State Area flag on top of City Hall. It is replaced with one with 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz's face. The citizens watch in fear.)
Normbots: You have a new leader. Put on your Dooferalls.
(A Normbot measures a man)
Normbot: 36 inch waist.
Man #4: No way. I'm a 34!

(2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz laughs as the bots march. Pinky secretly watches from a hole in a fence as a squad of Normbots come by. He uses his collar tag to reflect the sun, sending a signal to Peter the Panda, who is up in a building with several other OWCA agents. He motions, they push a dumpster. It falls and land on a makeshift catapult. Sending a load of tires onto the bots, Peter and the other agents leap down, and Pinky and a mouse and frog agent run out, they attack the bots.)
(Agent T (Turtle), a raccoon agent, and a cat agent trap a bot in a tire and roll him into a wall. They smile, but then another bot throws a tire at them. The bot they threw flexes, snapping the tire, and the other agents are quickly beaten and thrown into a pile. The Normbots encircle them, when suddenly, Perry leaps down in front of them and assumes a martial arts pose.)
(A bot tries to hit him, he dodge. Perry leaps on another Normbot, then leaps away as it is hit instead of him. He leaps onto another Normbot, one of the other bots aims its laser. Perry leaps away as the laser is fired, melting the head off the other bot. Perry does the same thing to several other Normbots, until one grabs him from behind and slams him against a wall. It is about to punch him, when one of the radio controlled baseballs hits it in the face. The bot looks and it keeps hitting it, smashing its face in, it drops and Perry is freed.)
(The ball flies back to Phineas, who is wielding the launcher atop Rover. Perry salutes him, Phineas salutes back; Rover then bounds down the street. We hear a mooing and see Ferb wearing a cowboy hat, leading a stampede of the Robot Bulls. Rover and the bulls tear through the Normbots as the agents cheer. Perry leaps up on top of Rover and he and Phineas hug.)
Phineas: So, I guess you trusted us after all. (Perry smiles)
(The kids from Danville all arrive, each riding or wielding one of Phineas and Ferb's past inventions. Baljeet emerges from a phone booth in the top part of the Beak suit)
Baljeet: Oh, I was wrong, it was not for me!
(Buford stomps in, riding the platy-posterior)
Buford: Heads up, platy-posterior coming through!
(Candace and Stacy arrive, each controlling one of the treehouse robots)
Candace: Now this is what I call busting!
(Stacy pushes a button, the two robots bump fists. The other kids show up, riding many other inventions, such as the rollercoaster, Meap's upgraded ship, and the continent painting helicopter from the theme song, a copter brings in the robot shark from "The Belly of the Beast"', piloted by Django Brown. The paper-mâché plane from "De Plane! De Plane!" flies by, and the hot air balloons from "Last Train to Bustville" drop several containers, out of them march several small armies of Phinedroids and Ferbots. Albert in his dragon costume rides in, driving the Holy Mackerel. Peter, Pinky, and Agent T get on the kiddie rides.)
Phineas: Alright, everyone. Let's kick some robot chassis!
(they cheer, Love Händel walks up)
Danny: Phineas! Anything we can do?
Phineas: Yeah, musical accompaniment!
(They play as the kids charge into battle)
(Song: Robot Riot)
♪We're gonna kick some robot chassis♪
♪So you better tell your robot nation♪
♪To say your robot prayer, 'cause you better prepare♪
♪For an automaton annihilation♪
♪You think you're gonna take us down♪
♪Well, mechanical man you just try it♪
♪You gonna ride that rail out of town♪
♪This is a Robot Riot!♪
♪I think you know what I mean♪
♪This is a Robot Riot♪
♪I'm gonna break you down♪
♪And sell you for scrap metal♪
♪But I'll keep enough to build myself a trampoline♪
♪'Cause your momma was a blender♪

♪You know you're gonna lose and sing the robot blues♪
♪You'll blow a fuse and take a robot snooze♪
♪I will deactivate ya, because I kinda hate ya♪
♪Don't wanna beat around the bushes, gonna decimate ya♪
(Phineas and Perry fire the remote controlled baseballs, smashing them into the Normbots, they high five. Stacy chases a group of bots, Candace slides down the roller coaster track and they both leap, the two smash together, crushing the Normbots between them. The Phinedroids and Ferbots leap off the wings of the paper mache plane and swarm down onto the bots. Isabella rams her ride into one and pushes it to another group, she leaps off as it slams into them, blowing them up.)
Isabella: Yes!
♪Oh man it's on!♪
♪I'm gonna rip you up and put you back together♪
♪In a new configuration just to mow my lawn♪
♪'Cause your sister is a fridge and you know her light is always on♪
♪This is a Robot Riot!♪
(Baljeet charges, he slaps at them, knocking the bots away)
(Ferb charges through more bots with the bulls)
(Perry and Phineas look up at the Other Dimensionator on top of DEI)
Phineas: We gotta do something about that portal!
(Perry fires a grappler hook up to the roof and holds out his hand for Phineas)
Phineas: Ferb, we're going to try and stop the portal!
♪This is a Robot Riot!♪
♪You better listen up♪
♪ I got some breaking news (Robot Riot)♪
♪I'm gonna melt you down and pour you on some baby shoes (Robot Riot)♪
♪I'm really on a mission♪
♪I call it demolition (Robot Riot)♪
♪And when i'm through you're gonna need more than a new transmission♪
♪All right!♪
(Ferb gives a thumbs up, Phineas takes Perry's hand and they zip up to the roof. They see Doofenshmirtz-2 manning the controls, and hides behind a pillar. Love Händel continues playing on Rover as Candace and Stacy emerge out of the wrecked treehouse robots and high five, a couple Normbots fire and they dodge.)
(Phineas looks at 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz. He motions to Perry, they nod and try to sneak over, but Platyborg lands in front of them, he grabs and throws them, they land and Phineas' baseball launcher slides away. Perry motions to the Other Dimensionator and hands Phineas his grappler, Phineas runs off as Platyborg lands, he and Perry grapple)
(Phineas fires a grapple hook up to the platform and rises up. 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz hears and looks.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): What? Oh!
(He throws a razor disc, which cuts the cord. Phineas falls, but lands on the couch from before. Doofenshmirtz-2 charges at him.)
I've had just about enough of you, you...
(Phineas hits him with the cushion Perry peed on) Ugh, what is on this? (He takes it off and throws it at Phineas, who ducks)
(Perry punches Platyborg and shakes his hand. Platyborg then punches Perry, which causes his fedora to fall off and sends him rocketing into a storage closet full of sports equipment, some of which falls out. Perry comes out in a football helmet and pads, charges and slams into Platyborg, hitting him into a wall. Platyborg punches him in the face and shakes his hand. Perry smirks, raps his knuckles on the football helmet and shrugs.)
(Candace and Stacy watch as the Normbots keep coming)
Candace: I was wrong, Stacy, about everything. I'm not a grown-up. I can't control mysterious forces. I can't even get my mom to see what my brothers are doing! (she smiles) Stacy, that's it! I can't get my mom to see what my brothers are doing! (she runs off)
Stacy: Candace, where are you going?
Candace: I'm gonna bust my brothers to my mom! And I'm gonna fail!

(DEI: Doofenshmirtz is still at the front door, talking to Mrs. Thompson on the intercom)
Doofenshmirtz: No, it's Heinz Doofenshmirtz. You borrowed sugar from me this morning!
Mrs. Thompson: I don't have any sugar. I had to borrow some from my neighbor this morning.
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, that's me. That's...
Mrs. Thompson: Oh, he's a nice man, but I hear he's divorced.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, THAT she remembers.

(Candace runs into the cineplex, which is showing "That Darn Fiancé". She goes into the theatre and sees her mom and dad wearing 3-D glasses, oblivious to the many Normbots flying around; she goes up to them)
Candace: Psst, mom!
Linda: Candace, what are you doing here?
Candace: You've got to come outside and bust the boys!
Linda: I'm not leaving now. The girl is about to forgive the guy for the clichéd misunderstanding... (a Normbot tears through the screen) After she battles these robots.
Lawrence: Whoa, this 3-D is amazing!
(Back in the streets, Ferb charges at another bot. Isabella runs up, manning a baseball launcher.)
Isabella: Ferb, we'll handle things down here! (she fires, hitting a bot) Go help Phineas!
(Ferb leaps off the bull and runs into a hardware store. He grabs two plungers, then runs to the Danville Impound Lot, where the Platypult is. He slides across it, activating the tail as he slides onto it. It launches him into the air and he uses the plungers to stick to the side of the Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. building, and he starts climbing.)

(On the roof, Phineas picks up some plates from the buffet table and chucks them at 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz, who dodges and uses cushions to block. Phineas then hits him with a bowl filled with pasta. Doofenshmirtz picks up a lamp and tries to hit him with it. He dodges and backs up to the Normbot controller. Doofenshmirtz-2 swings and Phineas leaps away, causing him to hit the panel, making the Normbots shudder and spark. Phineas hides and looks as 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz fiddles with the controller.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Oh come on, you stupid thing, work! (the Normbots go back to normal and continue)
Phineas: Oh, so that dish must be what's controlling the robots! Maybe I don't need to close the portal if I can just take out that... (he sees the baseball launcher) Oh, yeah!
(He runs to it, but 2nd Dimension Doofnenshmirtz grabs it)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Oh no you don't! Ha ha! Now the baseball is on the other foot! Or however that... that saying goes. I'm not really sure... (sees Phineas backing up) Hey, hey! Where are you going? (he aims at Phineas, and backs him into a wall) You know, all that's going to happen from you guys coming up here is that I'm going to have a brand new Platyborg! And maybe even a Boyborg too, huh? Try saying that five times fast: boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg... eh, I guess its not that hard to say, never mind.
(Platyborg punches at Perry, who dodges. He head-butts Platyborg, who dives at him. He uses his feet to kick him away. Platyborg leaps back in front of him and tries to hit Perry with the spike on the end of his tail. Perry dodges and takes off the pads and helmet. He uses it as a weapon to knock Platyborg into the buffet table, where his spike is impaled on a turkey.)
(Platyborg at first, tries to get up, but the turkey weighs him down. He then manages to get up, but the turkey is still stuck on the end of his tail. He tries to reach it, but can't. Perry smiles, amused, as Platyborg keeps trying to reach it. He sees and punches Perry in the face. He falls to the ground, they grapple. Platyborg tries to hit him, but Perry dodges, and he tickles Platyborg's neck, causing his tail to snap forward, planting the turkey over his head. He stumbles blindly and Perry kicks him, sending him back into a fuse box, which his spike pierces, electrocuting him.)
(He jolts and grabs two corn on the cob. The electricity burns the turkey and causes the corn to pop. Perry puts his hat back on and catches a kernel in his mouth. Doofenshmirtz-2 aims at Phineas.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): You know something kid, you've been a thorn in my side all day long...
(Perry looks and sees a bat on the ground, he whistles; Phineas looks) But that's about to change...
(Perry throws the bat)
(Slow-Mo) right now...
(He fires, Phineas grabs the bat and hits the ball away. It heads for the robot control dish.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (slow-mo) Noooooo!
(It hits, shattering it, Doofenshmirtz-2 cries as the bots shut down and fall out of the sky)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): (regular) Augh! My babies! No, what have you done?
(He runs off as the bots continue to fall. Isabella, Buford, and three of the Fireside Girls watch from under a bus stop.)
Isabella: It's weird that Perry's a secret agent, huh?
Buford: Yeah, but it was obvious in retrospect.
(Baljeet walks up, wearing only the top half of the Beak suit)
Baljeet: Has anyone seen my pants?
Buford: Yeah, they're over there.
(he points to Irving, who is in the legs, holding two crowbars and standing on a pile of dismantled Normbots)
Irving: WOLVERINES!

(Theatre)
Candace: Mom, if you care one iota about me, your family, and your city, you'll come outside with me right now!
Linda: Well, I guess I could use some more popcorn.
Candace: Great! (she pulls her out) Come on, come on, come on!

(Ferb arrives at the top)
Phineas: Ferb, bro! I just hit the best home run ever!
(Ferb gives a thumbs up, just then, the ground shakes and a chamber opens. Out of it rises a huge robot made to look like 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz. The head looks down at them.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Now, tremble before me! (laughs) No no, I'm down here.
(its arm moves, showing him in a cockpit built into the arm)
See? One last trick up my sleeve. It's me! See, I'm the trick up my...own sleeves. Cause look, I-I'm in the sleeve, get it? (they look) Ugh, pearls before swine.
(he pulls a lever, the bot aims back a punch) Hope you got your 3-D glasses, cause I'm coming at you!
(The arm extends and lets fly with a punch. He laughs and whoops. Phineas, Ferb, and Perry hold each other and brace for impact, when suddenly...)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey!
(The arm stops)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): What? I'm kind of in the middle of something here! (we see the arm is less than an inch away from impact)
Doofenshmirtz: I got a little something just for you...
(He reaches into his lab coat. 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz raises the arm to look. Doofenshmirtz pulls out the Choo-Choo the toy train.)
Here!
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Choo-Choo!
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, it's mine. See, I told you I never lost it. It was in a box in my pantry labeled "VHS Tapes". Go figure. Anyway, you can have it.
(2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz lowers the arm and leaps out)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): I can't believe it! Choo-Choo, it is you! (he takes it and hugs it close) Oh, heart melting, backstory resolving, evilness diminishing.
Doofenshmirtz: Eh, it's the least I can do.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): You know, I don't even know what I was thinking with the whole "evil robots" thing. Actually, when I look around, I-I'm really embarrassed. Here, let me clean this up.
(he pulls out a remote labeled SELF DESTRUCT) Look, "Self Destruct" button.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, you.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Yeah, here we go.
(He pushes the button, all the Normbots explode and vanish into thin air. In a kid's room, he plays with a toy robot, when it explodes as well.)

(The bots outside the theatre explode. A second later, Candace drags Linda out.)
Candace: Come on, come on. Hurry! (she motions for her to look)
Linda: Do I even need to say there's nothing there anymore?
Candace: Mom, you can say it all you want! (hugs her and does a little dance) There's nothing there! Woo hoo! I did it, I saved the world! (she stops and smiles, pause) You can go back to your movie now.
(Linda stares for a second, then goes back in)
(Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. rooftop. A portal is opened back to the 2nd dimension.)
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): Yeah, you know, we're totally cool now, I'm just going to go back to my home and live out the rest of my days with my Choo-Choo. Okay then, ciao!
(he steps through the portal) Ah, home, it's good to be... (the 2nd Dimension Fireside Girls (also known as the Firestorm Girls) march up) Uh-oh.
(2nd Dimension Major Monogram walks up)
Major Monogram (2nd Dimension): Book him, ladies.
Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension): You know, my crimes against humanity had just completely slipped my mind.
(they grab and drag him away)
(Candace runs up to Phineas and Ferb as the 2nd Dimension gang come out of the portal)
Candace: Hey, did you guys just see that? I totally saved Danville!
Candace (2nd Dimension): Good job, soldier.
Candace: So, what will you do now?
Candace (2nd Dimension): Wow, I haven't thought of anything but busting Doofenshmirtz for years. I don't know.
Candace: Well, I know what interests I'd pursue. (she points to 2nd Dimension Jeremy as he comes out of the portal)
Jeremy (2nd Dimension): Hey, here you all are.
Candace (2nd Dimension): I'll take that under consideration. And what about you, Candace?
Candace: You know, after all of this, I'm going to give myself a little more time to be young. It's not such a bad place to be.
Candace (2nd Dimension): You know what, me too. (they hug)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for teaching us all about summer. You know, opening our horizons, and teaching Ferb classical guitar.
(2nd Dimension Ferb strums a few chords)
(Platyborg then rises out of the mass of popcorn and throws off the turkey)
Phineas: Uh-oh.
(They look, he then reverts to pet mode and does a metallic sounding chatter)
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Hey, it's our Perry! (they go over to him) Looks like the evil was fried right out of him.
Phineas: Sorry he's mostly made of metal now.
Phineas (2nd Dimension): Are you kidding? That makes him extra cool! Thanks so much guys. (they head back to the portal)
Phineas: I'm glad we could help.
(Perry and Platyborg look at each other. Perry salutes and Platyborg smiles and salutes back. He enters the portal, it closes up.)
Phineas: Man, this was the greatest day ever. Imagine how much fun we can have together now that we know you're a secret agent!
(Major Monogram and Carl walk up)
Major Monogram: Yes yes, the next fifteen minutes should be a real hoot. Then, of course, Agent P will be sent away forever.
Phineas: What?
Major Monogram: Didn't he give you a pamphlet?
Phineas: We threw it away.
Major Monogram: Does anyone read those things?
Carl: I tried to warn you, sir.
Major Monogram: Kids, I'm sorry, but now that Agent P's cover has been blown, you won't be allowed to see him anymore.
Phineas: That's why you didn't want us to know your secret. (Perry nods) So we'll never see Perry again? There has to be another way!
Major Monogram: Sorry, Phineas. It isn't safe, you know too much.
Phineas: Now I never wished so much that I could un-know something.
Carl: Sir, maybe there is a way. What about Dr. Doofenshmirtz's Amnesia-nator?
Doofenshmirtz: I never built an Amnesia-nator. I think I'd remember building something like that.
Major Monogram: Well, that might work, but you'd all have to agree.
Phineas: So our choice is to: either forget the best day ever, forget the greatest adventure we've ever had, and forget meeting Agent P, or remember today, but never see Perry again?
(Long pause, everyone looks at Perry)
Ferb: Well, we've had a lot of great days, but we only have one Perry.
Phineas: Agreed.
All: Yeah.
(Later, OWCA Headquarters, we see everyone in the lab)
Major Monogram: (from inside) Alright everybody, tall kids in the back. (zooms to the inside of the lab) Just need to do a little more programming here, and we'll be ready to roll.
(Phineas and Ferb walk up to Perry)
Phineas: Hey, buddy. Ferb and I just wanted to say our goodbyes. You know, we thought we'd met the real you when we found out you were Agent P. But the fact is, pet, secret agent, they're both the real you. You are now, and always have been a great pet, and a great friend. We're going to miss you, Agent P. (Perry hugs Ferb, then hugs Phineas) I love you, pal.
(Monogram's eyes water)
Carl: Sir, are you crying?
Major Monogram: No, I'm sweating through my eyes.
Phineas: Okay sir, we're ready. (They walk back. Perry walks up to Major Monogram.)
Major Monogram: Okay Carl, we're all set.
(Pause)
Isabella: Uh, Major Monogram?
Major Monogram: (offscreen) Uh, yes?
Isabella: So, none of us will remember any of today?
Major Monogram: That's right.
(Isabella looks at Phineas and smirks)
Isabella: (firmly) Good. (she grabs him and kisses him right on the lips, Phineas gasps)
Phineas: (surprised) Isabella!
Isabella: Hit it, Carl!
Phineas: Wait, wait, wait...!
(There is a flash of white light, fade to black; later, Perry heads down to his lair. He sits in his chair and plugs a camera into the computer. A box comes up that says 'IMPORT PHOTOS?', he clicks YES. We see various photos being shown, such as Phineas taping a 'REBOOT ME' sign to a Normbot, Ferb making bunny ears behind Phineas and Perry as they ride in the mine car, Ferb holding up the cushion that Perry peed on, and Ferb pretending to stick his head in the Goozim's mouth.)

Oh, yeah!(laugh)

(Perry smiles; and we see he is looking at the last picture, Phineas and Perry hugging with Ferb next to them, and a box comes up that says 'SAVE PHOTOS?', he smiles again and clicks YES.)
