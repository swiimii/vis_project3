Part I
(Scene opens up in Phineas and Ferb's room showing that Phineas is sleeping)(Then the alarm clock at 6:59 AM. As it goes off, it makes a party blower sound, shows the words "Happy Birthday", two star flags pop up and confetti rains all over the alarm clock)
Phineas: (Wakes up, snoozes alarm clock) Another fantastic year older, and this is gonna be the best birthday ever! So, what are we gonna do, Ferb? (Camera pans to Ferb's bed, showing a card) Ferb? (Camera zooms in) Huh! A note! (Gets off his bed) "For the celebration of your birthday, just follow these clues to show you the way". Cool! It's like a birthday adventure. But hey, where's Ferb?
(Outside, Ferb puts on a fedora and runs out the gate)
♪ Ferb! ♪
Candace: (Talking on her cell phone) I can't believe it! It's Phineas's birthday, and I still don't know what to get him! What can you get for the boy who can make everything? (Sighs) It's my fault. I should have been thinking about this before, but I've just been so distracted by trying to bust Phineas and-- Wait! (Notices Ferb behind a tree; The garage door opens and Ferb runs into the garage) What is he up to? T-T-Y-L, Stacy!
(Inside the garage)
Isabella: Hey, Ferb! (Ferb takes off his fedora) We were just discussing our plans for Phineas' birthday. The circus we ordered won't be arriving 'til later in the day, (Irving walks up) but Irving had a great idea for a warm-up.
Irving: We should make a video compilation of all of Phineas' greatest moments!
Buford: What? Like on a clip show? (Crosses his arms) Lame.
Irving: Not where a genius like Phineas is concerned, watch this. (Turns on TV)
(Clips: Phineas quotes)
Phineas: Okay, Ferb. Let's see what we can do about that pesky gravitational pull. (Ferb presses a button on a controller)
Phineas: (Explaining Candace her mission) After you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free-fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch.
Phineas: (In a video game) Wow, a castle! Nice art direction, Ferb.
Phineas: (Riding on a rocket attached to a bike with Ferb and Candace) Good thing we had this extra rocket engine, huh?
Phineas: (Showing a giant paper-maché plane) Eat your heart out, Howard Hughes.
Phineas: (Showing Isabella a dining room) Behold! A romantic candlelit dinner for two.
Phineas: (Building a giant card house) We're almost finished with our exact replica of the Temple of Angkor Wat.
Phineas: (Showing a giant contraption) The Phineas-and-Ferb-edge-of-insanity-kiss-your-butt-goodbye-gravity's-a-stone-cold-sucker-nightmare-rail-skate-track-obstacle-course of doom!
Candace: Will you please tell me what's going on here?
Phineas: We're building an animation studio.
Phineas: (Exiting a giant bowling ball) That was amazing!
Phineas: (With Linda's tricked-out car) The flying car of the future, today, is still pulling a bit to the right.
(With the Candace Crusher)
Lawrence: A monster truck!
Phineas: Yeah! Isn't it sweet?
Phineas: (Revealing the rollercoaster) THE COOLEST... COASTER... EVER!
(Ferb reveals the coaster. A bird flies into it)
Irving: (Imitating fanfare. The camera zooms out as he imitates a kettle drum beat and turns off the TV)
Baljeet: Why did you not just use the kettle drum?
Irving: I never learned how to play. (Pushes the kettle drum away, and a cat yowls) Anyway, (Candace looks through the window and swoons) By utilizing my extensive collection of spy cameras, I've got footage of everything that Phineas has ever done. But I haven't had time to edit all of it-- Well, what, with-- You know, filming more. (He and Baljeet, Buford and Isabella walk to Ferb) I've divided up all the video into 3 parts. (Shows the CDs) Each of you take a section, (Isabella, Baljeet and Buford each takes a CD) Edit your tribute, and we'll meet at the party later.
(Candace shows an evil face. The garage door opens and Isabella, Baljeet and Buford run out of the garage. The garage door closes)
Candace: (Giggles)
Phineas: (Runs to the kitchen) "This birthday excursion will take you afar, you'll find your next clue where the 2x4s are". 2x4s, huh? Perry, are you thinking what I'm-- (Camera pans to Perry's bed) Hey, where's Perry?

(Scene shifts to Perry's lair)
Major Monogram: (To Carl) Okay, now let me to do the talking.
(Agent P walks to his seat)
Major Monogram: Oh, Agent P! There's a something we need to discuss for a while, you see Perry's job and performances which come up, (Perry's face became surprised) but don't get me wrong, it's just like your entrances became "lackluster" lately. (Perry's face became sad) We just expect more from you. Roll the footage Carl!
Carl: Right away sir.

Major Monogram: What happened to that guy? No pressure, but style counts. (Perry salutes and walks away sadly) Let's, uh, let's give him a few days, and then we should talk to him about his exits.
(Scene shifts to the Garcia-Shapiro house)
Candace: Hi-ya, Isabella.
Isabella: Oh hi Candace, what are you doing here? In my house?
Candace: Oh just barging around. You know me, big barger. So, what is that?
Isabella: Oh, just a little birthday video I'm editing for Phineas.
Candace: Then let's see.
(Candace plays the video)
Computer Phineas: (in the video, spliced together) We'll-Be-Together-Forever-Isabella.
Isabella: (Looks embarrassed at Candace) Hehe...
Candace: But... don't you have anything more, you know, unusual?
Isabella: Of course! Watch this. (Presses play)
Isabella: (in video) I saw the best girls of my troop, hungry, patchless, out of uniform.
Candace: Okay, seriously, whoa. I mean, like Phineas's inventions?
Isabella: Nope, I didn't get any of that footage.
Candace: Then you're useless to me. Candace out!
Isabella: (After Candace leaves) Hm... I'll have to talk to her about her exits.
(Isabella returns to editing her video)
Computer Phineas: (spliced again) Isabella-Will-You-Marry-Me?
Isabella: (dreamily) Ah... The magic of digital editing!
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪
Doofenshmirtz: I see you, Perry the Platypus, now kick the door... (Perry kicks the door and the trap, a large TV, activates) Haha! Gotcha, Perry the Platypus! Hee hee hee! I saw you coming from my video surveillance system! Ah, if I had a nickel for every time I've trapped you.

(back to Doofenshmirtz in front of his wall of TVs)
Doofenshmirtz: Huh, I thought it would be more than that. I guess I could get a candy bar or something. Anyway, I've been studying all my previous schemes and I figured out why they always seem to fail. Let's see if you can figure out what they all have in common. Look!

Doofenshmirtz: I call it my Turn Everything Evil-inator.
(back to Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: See? They all have "-inator" in the name. That is why they fail. Which is why I named my latest creation, The Video-Beam-Hijack-Non-Inator! You see, I added "non" to the name, because "non" means "not", so it's a "not-an-inator", therefore, it can't not fail. Get it? I mean, it can't... can't fail, it... okay.
(Scene shifts to Candace)
Candace: Heeheehee... (phone rings) Hi, Mom.
Linda: (on the phone) Where are you, Candace? You promised you'd help frost the cake after you got Phineas's present.

Phineas: Have you seen Ferb today?
Worker: No, but I did see a guy in a robotic bird-themed super suit shooting eggs out of his wrist.
Phineas: (points his finger at her)
Worker: ...and that was Ferb, wasn't it?

Phineas: Nah, I was just thinking to myself. It's a clip show. So where'd you see Ferb?
Worker: He was right over here. That suit really holds a lot of eggs.
(the two of them walk to a wall with a picture of a Slushy Dawg on it, made from the eggs, and a pile of egg shells at its base)
Phineas: Huh. A visual clue!

Part II
(Scene opens up at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, "trapped Perry the Platypus." It's my favorite show; but you know what, my least favorite show is this. (turns on T.V.)
Announcer: (Roger is seen chopping some wood and kissing a baby. He is also seen at the Tri-State Area costume ball in a superhero costume with a woman in a cat costume. Then, Roger jumps into the air a la Superman, while the woman looks up in surprise.) Culture. Square-jawed. Danville Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz. Profiled on: "Younger Brothers of the Useless."
Doofenshmirtz: It's a 12-part mini-series running all day long; nothing but propaganda. He can't really fly, they did that with wires. So that is why I invented the Video-Beam-Hijack-Non-inator; "non"-inator, mind you, for reasons we've already discussed. With this, I will preempt the biography of my brother so he can't rely on that 14-karat smile and his freakish ability to not be despised. I mean, look at this city, look at all that urban blight that, uh... that isn't there anymore, and... and the public transportation, all... uh, clean and... efficient and... (sighs) running on time... Okay, let's just say I'm gonna let Roger warm up the room for me, then I'll preempt his ridiculous documentary with live video of me announcing my take-over of the Tri-State Area. (puts on Roger's glasses) And maybe I'll put on these glasses like he wears. (tosses them aside) I don't know. What am I, gonna throw away my best stuff on a clip show? Forget it. Now let's light this pop stand. Could take a while, though. It's gotta... it's gotta warm up... vacuum tube.

(The repairman uses an odd-looking wrench to fit the pipe in with the arrows pointing opposite directions. The pipe splits along each fitting, causing the very end of the pipe to launch off; it hits a one-way sign, turning it around. This redirects a DVD recycling truck towards oncoming traffic; alerted by other drivers' horns, the truck driver swerves off the road. The truck breaks through a guardrail and slides down a hill)
Candace: (having picked up the dollar) Hah! (gasps)
(The truck hits a barrier at the bottom of the hill, causing its back doors to open, sending a wave of DVDs at Candace. Candace holds her DVD above the incoming wave and successfully walks out of the pile, still with her disc)
Candace: Ha-ha, I made it! Hee, hee, hee, hee...
(The pipe fitted by the repairman bulges and bursts, sending it and the wrench flying, hitting a few birds on the way up.)
Candace: (turns around) AAAAHHH! (the birds dive-bomb her as she runs away) Birds?! What is happening?!?! (she dodges the birds)
Candace: That's it! I made it! I... AAAAHHH! (she trips and launches the DVD into the air) Oh no!
Candace: (seeing a parade of elephants coming down the street) A circus? What the...
(Candace does a front flip and kicks the disc back into the air just before reaching the elephants. She jumps onto the elephant's back, swings down a "PHINEAS" banner held by the circus performers, and zips past a unicycling clown. Candace suddenly finds herself juggling two bowling pins and the disc while unicycling, and launches off a road construction ramp. Candace catches the disc and rolls down a dirt pile to a stop.)
Balthazar: Can I have your autograph?
(the clown's hat lands on Candace's head, and the wrench lands in Candace's other hand)
Candace: Oh yeah, baby, it's happenin'.
(Back at D. E. I.)
Doofenshmirtz: (seeing the tilted Non-inator) Oh, now look what you made me do... 40 seconds ago, Perry the Platypus. Now I'm going to have to even out the legs! But first, I'm going to get even with you! (pushes the remote's button, but it doesn't work) I, oh, I, uh, I... I seem to be out of batteries. Could you wait while I go get the, um, uh... (Perry points another remote at Doofenshmirtz and fires) Perry the Platypus, no! (Doofenshmirtz ducks; the remote's laser misses him and hits the Non-inator, which explodes) Okay, maybe the "-inator" name wasn't the problem.
(Perry jetpacks away from D. E. I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Curse you, Perry the Platypus! (Perry hears this and smiles)
(Back at Phineas' party)
Linda: I just feel so bad we missed the video presentation while we were at the bakery.
Lawrence: Well, we couldn't very well serve that cake, the way those wild penguins tore it apart, could we? And to think that they were carried away by a freak tornado!
Candace: (running up) Mom! Mom! Mom!
Linda: Candace, you missed half the party!
Lawrence: (walking away) Triangular bubbles? How'd they ever do that?
Candace: That's okay, cause this is it-it-it!
Linda: This is what, Candace?
Candace: The day I finally win. The day I get what I've been after all summer long!
Linda: Oh, that.
Candace: Because today, I have this! (holds up the DVD)
Linda: What's that?
Candace: This? Oh, this is only...
Phineas: (over applause) Thank you, thank you, everyone!
Linda: Hold on, honey. I think Phineas is going to speak.
Phineas: (on stage) I just have to say, I'm a lucky guy. I mean, so far, this has been a rockin' great summer! I've sure had plenty of fun. But it's not about satisfying your personal desires. It's about all of you. Being surrounded by the best family (Linda and Lawrence hug) and the best friends (Buford and Baljeet tear up) anyone could ever hope to have. All the people I love, (Isabella sighs) and who love me right back. (Irving sighs) Today was a great day. The best day ever!
Candace: (looks at the DVD, then at Phineas; she starts bawling) WAAHH-HHHAHH! I can't do it! Not on his birthday! I mean, what kind of person am I? (smashes the DVD with the wrench)
Phineas: (walking up) Aw, Candace. You're a great person! Why, if I had a nickel for every time you did something nice for me... well, I wouldn't know what to do with that much money!
Candace: But I didn't even get you a...
Phineas: Wait a minute. (pointing at the wrench in Candace's hand) Is that... it is! A left-handed flange tuner! I've been looking for one of those forever!
Candace: You've been... huh?
Phineas: They're impossible to find! Custom-made for Danville's sewage repair, but they have a thousand uses! (takes the wrench) I love it! It's just what I've been wanting! (hugs Candace) Thank you, Candace!
Candace: (hugs Phineas) You're welcome.
Phineas: You're the best sister ever. (counter appears in the top-right of the screen, reading "$0.05")
Linda: All right, everybody. (next to a cake with a Phineas ornament on top) Who wants cake? (all the kids run up to her, shouting chaotically)
Buford: Buford wants cake! Buford wants cake! Me, me, me!
Baljeet: Me! I want the largest piece!
(Perry walks up to Candace and Phineas, and then chatters)
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry. Some day, huh?
Candace: Yep, and I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. (she and Phineas walk away)
Clown: Hello? Did somebody order a circus? (beat) Hello? I knew I should've gotten the down payment on the elephants.
