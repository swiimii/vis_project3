(Scene opens with Phineas and Ferb in the backyard of the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Phineas: We'll combine the zipperoo with the terror drop, and move clown town after the Ferris wheel, and we end the whole ride with a house of mirrors bouncy castle. It's great! A city-wide amusement park on a single track. And you only have to wait in line once!
Paul: Delivery!
Phineas: Hi Paul!
Paul: Hey boys, you ordered 20 tons of building material?
Phineas: We sure did!
Paul: Okay, sign here. Hmm, thought i had a pen here somewhere...
Phineas: No problem, I'll just use the pen you left here yesterday. (signs form) Ferb and I modified it so you won't lose it again.
Paul: Huh. What did you guys do, install a homing sensor?
Ferb: Actually, we just put a clip on it.
Paul: Cool! Haha, here's your form.

(Switches to Paul driving in his truck)
Paul: Hi, dad. Yes, I just delivered to Phineas and Ferb. Yes. Yes, they are. No, I left them the blue copy.
Paul's Dad: No, son. You always have to leave them the pink copy. The blue copy's yours. You gotta take your job more seriously. Now you're running seven seconds behind!
Paul: Dad, I'm not sure if I really wanna be a delivery guy.
Paul's Dad: Of course you wanna be a delivery guy. You just don't wanna be a delivery guy who's seven seconds behind. Step it up!
Paul: Alright, Dad. Talk to you later, bye. (hangs up phone; turns on radio)
Radio DJ: Hey hey, listeners, the WJOP's party van is out there somewhere in the Tri-State Area. The first lucky listener who spot the party van and say the Phrase that Pays, wins a special prize!
Paul: (radio off) Ooh, here's my next delivery.
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪
Paul: What a weird looking building. (goes into Evil Incorporated to find that the elevator has broken down) Out of order? Great! (struggles up the many flights of stairs) (knocks)
Doofenshmirtz: (from inside) It's open~.
Paul: (goes in with the package) Helloo. Delivery. (a cage falls from above, trapping him in a platypus-sized cage)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, you're not Perry the Platyp- Oh, sorry about that. (retracts the trap) I was expecting someone else.
Paul: No problem. Happens to me all the time.
Doofenshmirtz: Really? (signs the form)
Paul: I'm just kidding.
Doofenshmirtz: Aaa-ah. Hey nice clip.
Paul: Thanks. Hey, I like your place. What do you do here?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, you know, different things, but today I'm building a Juice-inator (shows Paul the Inator) It's going to turn City Hall into juice!
Paul: Oho, is it now?
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, then I'm gonna take over the Tri-State Area! You know, like you too.
Paul: Well, at least you got a plan. I haven't figured out what I'm wanna do with my life.
Doofenshmirtz: Don't sell yourself short, perhaps you can be one of my minions! Not an indoor minion, but a minion that keep the coalfires burning.
Paul: Yeah, I'm not sure that's a step up. Here you go (hands blue copy then leaves)
Doofenshmirtz: You should think about that offer! Miniony! It's a growth industry. (looks at the blue copy in his hand) Oh, he forgot to leave me the pink copy.
Paul: (as he gets inside his truck) Juice City Hall, what a character.
(drives away when he passes Phineas and Ferb inside their new fun ride)
Phineas: Hi Paul. (Paul waves at him)
Paul: That's what they did with the building material!
Radio DJ: We're still looking for that first listener to spot WJOP's party van, and say the Phrase that Pays--
(stops as sudden crash is heard when the back of Paul's truck is rammed by a van)
Paul: (getting off his truck to see the van) Hey, you're the WJOP party van!
Radio DJ/Party Van Driver: Hey, you're the first listener to spot us!
Paul: Wow! If only I knew the phrase that pays.
Radio DJ: (taps his bell) That's it baby. The phrase that pays is The Phrase That Pays! You win the grand prize!
Paul: I won? I won! (fanfare) What did I win?!
Radio DJ: The band Love Händel will play at your job! (van opens to show the band inside)

Paul: Delivery! Again.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh goody, it's arrived. One last part for my Juice-inator.
Paul: Oh right, you're still on that juice thing.
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, my Juice-inator, my giant menacing machine that will turn City Hall into juice, completely discrediting and embarrassing my brother the Mayor at his 5pm media event. Step One, in my evil scheme to take over The TRI-STATE AREA!!
