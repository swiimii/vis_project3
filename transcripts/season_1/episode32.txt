(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house at night.)
Candace: But, Mom, it's true. The boys built an elevator to the moon in the backyard today.
Linda: Last time I checked, the yard was noticeably moon-elevator free.
Candace: But...
Phineas: It's true. We were up there! Ferb did the whole "one giant step" thing. Check out this moon stuff we brought back!
(trumpets playing triumphantly)
Candace: Hmm?
Lawrence: Oh. You boys are so adorable.
Candace: Ah! You don't believe it. I'm so over this.
Linda: Oh Candace, revel in your brothers' imagination. Makes life so much more fun.
Phineas: (Yawns) Pushing the boundaries of time and space sure makes a guy tired.
Linda: See? How fun is that?
Lawrence: Night, boys.
Linda: Night, mopey.
Candace: (Mimics) "See? How fun is that?" If only they'd believe me...
Lawrence: Look at this. I got a traffic ticket from that camera they installed across the street. Oh, that blasted device picks up everything on the block 24 hours a day.
Linda: Doesn't it run out of tape?
Lawrence: Oh, no. It's on a compressed CD thingamabob. It can store months of digital video.
Candace: Video.
Linda: Hon, you know we drive on the right.
(Camera pans outside to show the traffic camera)
Lawrence: Yes, yes, so you keep telling me.
Candace: Gotcha!

(Snoring, Wristwatch communicator vibrates; ♪ Spy theme)
Major Monogram: Excellent trick, Agent P. Sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but we are about to give you the most important mission of your career. Our computer indicates that a city security camera located near your civilian hideout has recorded your comings and goings as a secret agent. It's crucial to the agency's security that you get those recordings and bring them back to HQ for special disposal.
(Scene shifts to the traffic camera)
Candace: Heeheeheehee, heeheeheehee, heeheeheehee, hehhehhehheh, heeheeheehee. (Uses a ladder and climbs up to the traffic cam, removes the disk ♪ Hums) I'm just borrowing this! ♪ La-la-la-la-la ♪

Candace: (puts disk in laptop and gasps) There it is! The elevator to the moon, ha! And the time they built the rollercoaster and the beach and the roller rink! Ooooooh! (grabs pillow, laughter is muffled) Can it be? Actual proof? Everything they've done over the summer? (to Perry) Oh, Perry, it's soooooooo beautiful!
Phineas: Candace, you okay? Your muffled emotion woke us up. What'cha watchin'?
Candace: Oh, just a little summer mini-series called... "Evidence"!
Phineas: Oh, cool, our moon elevator! Mom would love this! I wonder if she's still up, let's show her!
Candace: Yes! Let's show Mom. (to Perry) Oh, Perry, Perry, Perry. I will remember this night always. Just think: on this very computer are the deliciously incriminating images from that CD I borrowed that will finally bust my brothers! (Laughs maniacally)
Linda: All right Candace, what's going on in there?
Candace: Mom, I finally got the evidence that'll prove that...
Linda: Oh! Not this again! Show me in the morning.
Phineas: How's 7:00 sound?
Linda: And you, too! Outta here!
Phineas: We're gonna pencil her in for 7:30.
Linda: 9:00.
Phineas: Make that 9:00.

Major Monogram: And hope.
Carl: And also wait.
Major Monogram: I already did "wait," Carl.
Carl: Did we do "hope"?

Phineas: Good thing we had this extra rocket engine, huh?
Norm: Whoop. Here we go again. Uh-oh. (Oil leaking) Someone forgot to replace the oil cap. (Jet rockets break) I guess I'm walking. (He walks over a draw bridge which lifts up with Norm in the middle of the opening)
Candace: (Screams)
Phineas: Go get him, Ferb!
Norm: Hey, kids, this is not a gymnasium! (He shakes Ferb off and the draw bridge opens completely. Norm hangs by his legs on both sides of the open drawbridge) Boy, I'm sure in a pickle.
(Phineas grabs Norm's wallet and takes out the DVD)
Candace: Whoo-hoo!
Norm: Perhaps I should've worn cleats.
