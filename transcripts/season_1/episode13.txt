(Scene opens up showing a movie theater shaped like the Sphinx)
Lawrence: Ooh, you know, kids, this theater was built over 70 years ago in this Neo-Egyptian style. And apparently, there used to be a pharaoh's tomb display with a mummy in a sarcophagus. I mean, you couldn't pick a better place to watch a classic, old mummy movie.
(Lawrence buys the tickets and they walk into the movie theater. They watch the movie)
Explorer: (In movie) There's an inscription here. An...an incantation of some sort. "Owah Tagu Siam!"
(The mummy wakes up at the sound of these words, looking straight at Phineas and Ferb in the audience. The boys stare back, and Phineas turns to his dad)
Phineas: Dad, where do you find a mummy?
Lawrence: Hidden deep in the bowels of the pyramids. (Phone rings) Whoops, better put this on vibrate.
(The mummy is now standing right behind the explorer, poised and ready to pounce)
Explorer: (In movie) The incantation will make the mummy come to life and obey your commands. Well, beat me with a chicken. (The mummy starts beating him with a chicken) Ow! What?! Ooh! Hey! Stop! It's an--ow! Hey!
Phineas: Cool! Dad, is it hard to get into a pyramid?
Lawrence: Yes, indeed. Often you had to negotiate many booby traps that were set centuries before.
(In the movie, the mummy has just stepped on a small rock, apparently a trigger for a booby trap)
Explorer: (In movie) You ridiculous mummy. You just tripped one of your own booby traps. (There is a rumbling noise, and rocks begin to fall on the explorer and the mummy) She's gonna blow! (They run for the exit, barely getting out in time)
Phineas: Awesome booby trap! (at Ferb) Ferb, we should get our own mummy.

Phineas: That would be awesome! (At Lawrence) Dad, can we--
Lawrence: (Snoring)
Phineas: Come on, Ferb. We'll be back before he wakes up.
Candace: Oh, those bozos aren't pulling anything on my watch! (Grunts)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb. Where's Perry?

Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz is at it again. It appears that he's purchased a string of odd items: One pound of blood sausage—Ech, that's my grocery list. Here it is. One magnet, one map of the city's drainage pipes and 2 tons of scrap metal. It's in your hands now, Agent P. Over and out.

Computer voice: Dive. Dive. Dive.
(Thud; Metal scraping)

Phineas: Mr. Employee, sir, where's the mummy exhibit?
Employee: (Presses button) Manager assistance requested.
Employee #2: Yes?
Employee: These boys want to know where the mummy exhibit is.
Employee #2: It's in storage. In the basement.
Phineas: Guess who's goin' to the basement!
Woman: Uh, excuse me, where are the restrooms?
Employee: Manager assistance requested.
Employee #2: Yes?
Candace: There they go.
(Door squeaks)
Phineas: Look! Pith helmets! We might be going the right way. Say something pithy.
Candace: That's it. I'm calling Dad.
(Cell phone vibrates)
Lawrence: (Laughs) Ohh!
Candace: Oh, forget it! I'm going in myself.
(Velvet rope barriers clanking)
(Screams)
Phineas: Did you hear that? Maybe it's the mummy.
Candace: (Screams) Eww. My shoe is all squishy!
(Ball rolling, Door and stairs clanking)
Phineas: Uh, Ferb? What are you doing? Woah! Who know looking for mummies would be so much fun? Watch this! (Thud) Ugh!
(Ball rolling)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb, this was our first booby trap! Woo! Hey, look! The storage! We're here!
Candace: Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, when I catch them... (Ball rolling) (Screams)
(Pipe breaks)
(Pipe and vent clanging)
Candace: Oh, give me a break!
(Ball rolling, Elevator bell)
(Song: I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun! elevator music)
(Candace screams, Ball rolling; Continues screaming)
(Crash)
Candace: Bubble gum? Oh, really old, stale bubble gum! Blaugh! Phineas!

(Water bubbling)
Doofenshmirtz: Almost done, just this one more little bit!
(Suspense music)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus! As usual, your timing is incredible! And by "Incredible", of course I mean: COMPLETELY CREDIBLE! (Laser fires) No use, Perry the Platypus! I made this out of something that cannot be penetrated! Pure evil! And a blend of space-age polymers. You see, Perry the Platypus, I'm going to unleash the water held by this dam into that huge drainage pipe that leads directly to the ocean. The additional water will raise the sea level by 2%, and then my property one block from the shoreline will become beachfront property! (Laughs maniacally) And to release the water from the dam, I've invented a ray, which attracts wood like it attracts metal: The Wood-inator! Which was almost complete until you rudely interrupted me. Oh, look at this, Perry. It's my paintbrush. You know, the one you knocked out of my hand a few moments ago. Maybe you want to take it back from me now, huh? Huh, you want to try? (Laughs) Goodbye, Perry the Platypus! (Laughs maniacally)

Phineas: Owah Tagu Siam! (Air hissing) There's nothing here but fakey promotional lobby junk. For all we know, there might not be such thing as a mummy. (At Mummy Candace) Yeah, I'll be right with you. I mean-- (Gasps)
Candace: Phineas!
Phineas: (Screams; Slams door)
(Egyptian Guitar Solo)
[Candace screams]
Phineas: Wow, I didn't expect them to be so scary. I mean, can you imagine the angry, twisted soul hidden under those bandages?
Candace: Phineas!
Phineas: Makes me shudder. But you know what? We came down here looking for a mummy, and I'm not leaving without one. Let's get him!
(Egyptian Guitar Solo continues)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb. We got our own mummy! Now, how are we going to get it home?

Doofenshmirtz: And...finished! (Button beep)
(Perry chatters)
(Beaver trills)
(Drilling sound)
♪ Perry! ♪
Doofenshmirtz: It is working! (Laughs) It is functioning properly!
(Perry chatters)
Doofenshmirtz: (Gasps) Perry the Platypus? You defeated my bubble of pure evil? Ooh! (Lasers firing; Water flooding) Oh, no! What? (Bubble pops) Is my nose really that pointy? (Screaming and grunting)

Phineas: You know what this is? Our second booby trap! (Water splashing) There you are, Perry.
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: WOO-HOO-HOO! OH YEAH! WOO-HOO! OH YEAH! (at Candace) Hey, Candace, you missed all the fun. Allow me to introduce our mummy. (realizes the "mummy" isn't there) Hey, where's our mummy? Mummy? Mummy?
Lawrence: Well, Mummy has supper waiting for us at home. (At Candace) Candace, why are you all wet?
Candace: (Growls)
(In the car)
Ferb: You know, mummies had their brains pulled out through their nose.
Candace: (Scoffs) The lucky ones.
