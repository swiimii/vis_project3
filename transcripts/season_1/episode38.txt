(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Grandpa Reg: And that, ladies and gents, is how I defeated the wild tigers in the Amazon.
Phineas: Awesome story, Grandpa Reg.
Lawrence: Well, I'm sure you'll hear plenty more fantastical stories during Gran and Gramp's visit.
Linda: You know, hon, I was thinking we could all head to the mall.
Grandma Winifred: What a splendid idea! I'd love to treat Candace to some new clothes.
Candace: (Gasps) I'll be in the...car.
Phineas: Hey, Mom. Could we just stay home and hear some more of Grandpa's cool stories?
Linda: Sounds good to me.
Lawrence: Wonderful. We'll see you boys later.
(Linda, Lawrence, Candace, and Grandma Winifred leave)

Grandpa Reg: My boy, what's this behind your ear? It's me scrapbook!
Phineas: How'd you do that?
Grandpa Reg: It's just a little bit of "How's you're father". I may seem like a barmy ol' git now, but when I wasn't so long in the tooth, I had some grand larks and engaged in a fair amount of derring-do.
Phineas: Translate.
Ferb: When he was younger, he did a bunch of stuff.
Grandpa Reg: Here I am as a young lad. I made my livin' work at the family Fish and Chips shop. But I was destined for bigger things. I was known as The Great Flying Fishmonger. Here's my first jump over my dear mum's tea society. Me jumpin' a whale, a ton of crumpets, the Queen Mum. But there was one jump that haunts me to this day; McGregor's Gorge of Doom.
(Flashback)
Grandpa Reg: (Narrating) People turned out by the thousands to witness me in my trusty motor bike, the Holy Mackerel, make our biggest jump yet. The event was so massive, I hired a local band to write me a theme song.
Band: (Dirge-like) ♪ He's a Fishmonger, and he flies ♪
Grandpa Reg: But it wasn't exactly a toe-tapper. Then all of a sudden, it started to rain. I had to postpone my great feat. The second go at it weeks later had the same result! And yet another attempt; nothing but blasted rain again.
Man: Let's go!
Woman: Yeah. I've got teeth not to brush.
(Flashback ends)
Grandpa Reg: Over the years, my eyesight went, and with the lumbago... (Grunts) ...Sciatica... (Creaking) ...Bursitis and... Wait for it...(Boing!) Trick knee, jumpin' McGregor's Gorge is an intention lost to the past.
Phineas: Wow, Grandpa. So whatever happened to the Holy Mackerel?
Grandpa Reg: She's right over there. Although I see your mother turned her into a lamp.
Phineas: Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!
(Scene shifts to Candace)
Candace: Oh, Grandma, you're gonna love this mall! I'll show you my favorite store, and there's this little dress that-- (Ding) Hmm... (Dialing) Stacy, I have a strange feeling that ground just broke in my backyard. I need you to get over there and tell me what's going on.
(Scene shifts to the backyard)
(Trucks beeping)
Phineas: Judging from this photo of McGregor's Gorge, we're right on track! Who's the tiger?
Isabella: Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Hey, Isabella. We're helping Grandpa Reg fulfill his crushed dreams.
Isabella: Where's Ferb?
Phineas: He's in the garage restoring the mackerel.
(Briefly, Ferb is seen working on the mackerel in the garage, he stops to eat a grilled cheese sandwich)
Isabella: Cool. Well, I brought this cute little toy over for Perry. Where is he?
Phineas: Huh. I don't know.

(Scene shifts to Perry's lair)
Carl: Oh, hey, Agent P. Monogram's thrown his back out...
Major Monogram: I'm on the floor, Agent P.
Carl: ...so I'll be giving you your assignment, okay? Okay.
Major Monogram: Do a closeup.
Carl: Huh? Oh, yeah. Huh. (Beep) (Clears throat) Doofenshmirtz has been purchasing some suspicious items: Bags of sand, and extra-long shoelace. We know he's up to no good. Get out there and see what he's up to. (at Major Monogram) How was that?
Major Monogram: Just hand me my pills, Carl.

(Phineas and Ferb lead Reg out; Reg has his eyes covered)
Grandpa Reg: What's all the kerfuffle, lads?
Phineas: You can open your eyes now.
Grandpa Reg: (puts arms down, monocle falls off) Blimey! It's McGregor's Gorge and the Holy Mackerel! Ferb, you've restored my pride and joy! But, uh, I can't operate a motorbike in my condition. Remember the- (Boing!)
Phineas: No problem. Ferb's tricked out the whole bike. Lumbar support, padded seating, ergonomic controls, and the best part - Side cars! See, as much as we wanna help you fulfill your dream, we also really want to jump a gorge.
Grandpa Reg: Well, then you'll come with me. The Flyin' Fishmongers shall jump again!
(Fanfare)
Grandma Winifred: Oh, my dear! You look like a queen. Brava!
Candace: (wearing British clothes) Uh, can we get out of here, like, now? Before anyone I know happens to see--
Jeremy: Candace? I almost didn't recognize you.
Candace: Jeremy! I-- I, uh--
Jeremy: I gotta meet my Mom at the food court, but I'll see ya later.
Candace: (Laughs nervously) (Phone rings) Hello? Oh, hey, Stacy. (At Linda) Mom! Stacy just told me the boys built a huge gorge in our backyard!
Linda: That hat might be a bit too tight.

♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.! ♪
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, just come in! Into my trap! Yes! Sticky flypaper, Perry the Platypus! (Laughs) Quick story? Back in Druselstein in the days of my youth, there was a bully named Boris, and he always wore big, black boots. They called him "Big Black Boots Boris". He was always kicking sand in my face. When I was in the sandbox; Sand. My first date; Sand! Balancing my checkbook; Sand! The beach-- Oddly enough nothing. But I couldn't relax, because I kept waiting for it. Now, though, he will be the one doing the waiting. Behold! The Now who'd blinded by sand-inator! Or maybe the Who's crying now-inator or, something like...something with the "Inator" suffix. In any case, it's a giant sand kicking machine! You see, Perry the Platypus, Boris has moved to the Tri-State Area, so now, I am going to cover his entire house in sand! (Laughs maniacally)

(Scene shifts to Buford and Baljeet standing on a sidewalk corner)
Baljeet: Come see The Flying Fishmonger jump McGregor's Gorge! Tell your friends!
Buford: Do you know how dumb you look?
Baljeet: I thought it would be a good way to get more attention.
Girl (Cindy): I love your outfit. It's so cute.
Baljeet: Gorge!
Buford: Gorge jump!
Baljeet: Fishmongers fly again!

Candace: These two have really done it this time, Mom, (with eyes closed) look at what they did to the backyard!

Linda: Wow! (gasps, her perspective) You guys made the lawn look great! (At this point, Candace turns around) Oh, it's all weeded and watered. Oh, well done.
Candace: I...I... (Squeaks) I...
Linda: What else did you do today?
Grandpa Reg: Well, these two roister-doisters wheeled out me old iron, built a crackin' match for McGregor's Gorge, and helped this daft ol' git one last knees-up.
