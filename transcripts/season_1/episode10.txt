Phineas: (at the camera) She means well.
Linda: I'll be back in a few hours. Have fun!
Candace: Yeah, right. You better not pull any of your weird stunts, got it?
Phineas: (Western drawl) Don't fret none, school marm.
Candace: So, he was like totally checking me out when little Miss Pants walks in front of me. Yeah, yeah! So I was like "Uh, hello?" and so she was like "Oh no, you di-in't!" and I was like "Oh yes, I di-id!"
Man: Mighty sorry, Buckaroos. Time to rein in those ponies.
Phineas: Hey, Isabella. What are you doing here?
Isabella: I just earned my milking badge, and it was so easy. All you do is squeeze and pull and squeeze and pull and squeeze and pull and squeeze and pull, and- so, whatcha doin'?
Phineas: We're riding ponies, (Western drawl) but it makes a feller hanker for the real thing. You know, livin' out on the open range. Ridin', ropin', brandin'. Bustin' broncos and breakin' wind with your amigos under the western skies. (Normal voice) Heck, we could even ford a stream! I don't even know what that means, but it sounds fun! (Spits) Oh, and spitting. Hey, where's Perry?

(Suspense music, Lasers firing)
Major Monogram: ...Yeah. And she was like "Oh no, you di-in't!" and-- Oh, there you are, Agent P. Oops. I forgot to turn off the laser sharks again, didn't I? My bad. Anyway, the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is at it again. Not only does he have 3 books about insects overdue at the library, but he's cornered the market on aluminum siding. He's hold up on his water fortress on Lake Winimahatikihaha. Ha-ha. I love saying that. You must find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. That is all.
