Part I
TV Announcer: From the PFT studio in marginally attractive downtown Danville, animated live in front of a studio audience, it's the Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown! And now, our hosts, from opposite ends of the moral, ethical and philosophical spectrum, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz and Major Francis Monogram!
Major Monogram: Hello Danville!
Doofenshmirtz: Yes, we're taking a break from our usual hostili—hold on, I've gotta go back one. Your first name is Frances?
Major Monogram: Yes. Spelled with an i.
Doofenshmirtz: "Spelled with an i? Wouldn't that be "Frinces?"
Major Monogram: No, F-R-A-N-C-I-S. It's the masculine spelling.
Doofenshmirtz: Francis?
Major Monogram: Yes. Anyway, we're not here to discuss my name. We're here because kids all over the world logged on to vote for their favorite Phineas and Ferb music videos. And we're countin' 'em down! Starting with number 10. Are ya ready, Dr. D?
Doofenshmirtz: Fran, Frances, Franny. Yes, very macho.
Major Monogram: You see, this is why I just go by "Major".

Stacy: So what do you think your brothers are doing?
Candace: Who cares?
Major Monogram: So how did you like that one D-man?
Doofenshmirtz: Too loud. Kids today with their rock and roll.
Major Monogram: Well, here's a deaf jam that's really kicking it old school.
Doofenshmirtz: You know that street lingo thing? You can't really pull that off.
Major Monogram: Oh, roll number nine.
Doofenshmirtz: Just telling you as a friend!

(Shows Major Monogram with Cindy)
Major Monogram: I'm standing here with Cindy, an animated member of our studio audience.
Irving: (pushes Cindy aside) Phineas and Ferb rock! Wooooo!
Major Monogram: Okay then, let's throw it over to my partner in crime. Not that I would perpetrate a crime with him of course, I'd never... (at Carl) Carl! Who wrote these cue cards?
Carl: Agent M, sir.
(Camera pans to Agent M, who's typing on a typewriter)
Doofenshmirtz: What's that all about? He's using a typewriter. When was the last time you saw someone using a typewriter? What is this, 1987?
Major Monogram: Well...
Doofenshmirtz: You realize that most of the kids watching this show have never even seen a typewriter, right?
Major Monogram: We're on a budget.
Doofenshmirtz: So you went to an antique store...
Major Monogram: Moving on. Number eight; roll tape!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, so you got tape, you're not just using film, or-or hand shadows...

(Crowd oohs)
Doofenshmirtz: You see, when I was a small boy, my parents would never let me watch music videos...
Major Monogram: No no no! We don't have time for an emotionally scarring back-story.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, maybe I should give you an emotionally scarring front-story!
(Doofenshmirtz walks off)
Major Monogram: Okay, that doesn't even make any sense.
(Camera pans out to show Doofenshmirtz in a monster truck)
Doofenshmirtz: It doesn't have to, I got a monster truck! Wooohooo!

Doofenshmirtz: What Francis doesn't know is that this isn't just a Music Video Clip-inator, it's really a Music Video Mind-Control-inator! AHAHAHAHAHAHA- (Notices crowd, maniacal music stops abruptly) Oh... I didn't say Mind-Control-inator, I said... Mimes control my gators! See, look over there!
