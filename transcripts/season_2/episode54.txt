Act I
(The show's logo zooms in, acting as the sun with the Episode's title and the names of the creators)
♪ Summer belongs to you! ♪
(Scene opens showing Candace dialing a number on her cell phone before suddenly switching to Jeremy, who is in bed, sleeping. His phone rings and he picks it up.)
Jeremy: Uhh, hello?
Candace: Hey, Jeremy! It's me, Candace!
Jeremy: Oh, hi Candace. You realize it's like... 2am in Paris.
Candace: Oops! Ahahah... Sorry... I... was just wondering how your vacation's going.
Jeremy: Actually, it's funny you called because you were in my dream just now.
Candace: (Excited) Really?
(Candace hears a rumble from outside)
Jeremy: Yeah, it was weird... You and I were in this Dixieland band and there was an iguana playing an oboe...
(Another rumble is heard)
Candace: I gotta go, Jeremy. I'll call you later. (Runs outside, calling someone else) Mom! Do you hear that?
Linda: I can't hear anything over all this road construction.
Candace: (As she talks the robot is jumping behind her causing her to pause a few times) But Mom, they've built a giant...rope jumping robot and it's... Phineas will you turn that thing off? I'm trying to bust you!
Phineas: We can't, its become self-aware! The jump roping was his idea!
(car horn)
Candace: Mom!
(Linda pulls up)
Candace: Mom! Mom!
Linda: Okay, I'm here. What did you wanna tell me?
Candace: Backyard now!
Linda: (Slightly irritated) Excuse me?
Candace: Backyard now, please?
Robot: I jump, therefore I am.
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry.
Candace: Right back here, Mom! (eyes closed) Look, there they are.
(The robot has suddenly disappeared)
Linda: Hi, kids. Did you have fun today?
Phineas: Yes, yes we did.
Linda: Good for you. I would've been home sooner, but it took me an hour to drive around the road construction in the neighborhood. It sure would be helpful if they could just make the days a little longer. (chuckles) Who do I call about that?
(A text appears that says "You're watching TV!" and a "DING" can be heard)
Phineas: Hey, do you mind? We have a visual gag going on here. (It disappears to reveal Ferb used a triangle to make the noise) Thank you! (To Ferb) Our vacation is more than halfway over, and what have we accomplished? Okay, so we built a rollercoaster, we traveled through time twice, found Atlantis, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, see? We've hardly done anything! We need a real challenge. We need to create the biggest, longest, funnest summer day of all time!
(A fanfare is heard and the camera pans out to reveal it was Ferb playing brass instruments)
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!
♪ Doofenshmirtz in a Jet Airplane! ♪
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Well, Vanessa, are you looking forward to seeing Tokyo on our daddy-daughter trip?
Vanessa: Yeah... I was really hoping for Paris. I mean, I did drop all those hints, but I guess Tokyo is more exotic.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Yes, that's why I chose Japan over Paris at the last moment! That makes perfect sense. There is no other ulterior motive behind it all, so, you know...
Airplane Captain: Uh, this is your captain speaking, we're expecting a slight delay for our arrival to Tokyo.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: That's always something. Turbulence, headwinds, giant jump-roping robots...
Robot: (Hanging on the jet airplane) I dangle, therefore, I am...
(Scene shifts to the master bedroom)
Candace: So Mom, while you're away, I'm in charge, right? For two whole days?
Linda: That's right. Remember, no boys over.
Candace: Of course, Mom. Jeremy's in Paris anyway. So... When you say I'm in charge, what exactly do you mean by that?
Linda: Well, to put it simply, I mean, "You're in charge."
Candace: So if Phineas and Ferb are up to something bust-worthy, and I am, as you say... "In charge", I have free reign to call you as many times as necessary?
Lawrence: Quite the contrary, Candace. Being in charge means you handle things yourself.
Linda: Yup. Basically, if you're really in charge, you won't need to call at all. You see, if the boys are doing something bust-worthy, that means you're not doing your job and you would be in trouble too.
Candace: Woah, woah, heavy! By busting the boys, I bust myself?
Lawrence: Ah, there's the rub. Right next to the pair o' ducks. I'm also packing this book of puns!
(Outside of the house...)
Linda: Bye kids!
Candace: Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! Have a nice time!
Phineas: Have a successful endeavor!
(Later; in Candace's room...)
Candace: (Dreaming) Paris... French girls and... Jeremy... Iguana playing an oboe... (She sits up and calls someone) Stacy? I am freaking out here!
(On the other line)
Stacy: Ugh... I'll be right over.
Candace: Cool! Thanks! And could you bring some breakfast? (Stacy hangs up) Hello?
(Scene shifts to the backyard)
Isabella: So Phineas, whatcha doin'... Up so early?
Phineas: Today is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year! And Ferb and I are gonna make it even longer.
Isabella: So you built the Statue of Liberty?
Phineas: No... (Sees his invention in shape of the Statue of Liberty) Oh, wow. That is weird. (He removes the sheet cover) Behold! The Amazing Sun-Beater 3000!
Isabella/Fireside Girls: Wow! Amazing!
Buford: It's a name followed by a big number!
Phineas: It's fast and it runs on vegetable oil, so it's environmentally friendly. In this ship, we will travel around the world as the sun does, making this, the longest day of summer, even longer! That'll give us twenty-four hours of continuous daylight; and add the extra fifteen hours we would've had anyway, that's almost a forty-hour day!
Buford: It can't be done! There's only twenty-four hours in a day and that's that!
Phineas: Well, yes and no. You see, Buford, if you define the day by the passage of the sun, and we follow the sun by traveling around the...
Buford: Nah, nah! Don't try to confuse me with your sorcerous ways. There's nothin' I've ever seen that would make me believe you could pull this off. Except for that time-machine thing, and oh, and the rollercoaster! But other than that, nothin'! Oh, and the time you played that song when the platypus came back, oh... Man, nature just bends to your will, doesn't it?
Phineas: Yeah, nothing's impossible if you believe you could do it.
Buford: Well, I don't believe and therefore it's impossible. And what's more, I bet you can't do it!
Phineas: You bet us?
Buford: Yeah, I bet you! And if you lose, you're gonna have to stand up in front of everyone and say that you are governed by the laws of physics and summer's not whatever you want to make of it. And what's more, you've gonna spend the rest of your summer doin' nothin'!
Phineas: And what happens when we win?
Buford: Hmmm... I'll eat a bug.
Phineas: Buford, you'd eat a bug right now if we asked.
Buford: Are you asking?
Phineas: No.
Buford: All right. How about I give you back your bike I took when we were little?
Phineas: My bike!
(Flashback)
Baby Phineas: Bu gaga gu...
Baby Buford: Mine!
Baby Phineas: No... Bu gaga gu.
(Flashback ends)
Phineas: How about this? When we make it back here before the sun sets, you gotta give everyone their bikes back.
Random man: Mine was the one with the unusually large front wheel.
Buford: I still get to eat the bug though, right?
Phineas: Sure thing, Buford.
Buford: I want the bug.
Isabella: Phineas, what are you doing? You're putting your entire world view on the line. And for what? A bunch of bikes?
Buford: And a bug!
Phineas: Isabella, it isn't about the bikes. It's about my world view. You see, we all gotta ask ourselves just one question.

Phineas: ♪ Or at least that's the plan! ♪
(Everyone laughs)
Chaka Khan: ♪ Of course, first you're gonna have to fix this wing, yeah! ♪
Hey, where's Perry?
(Perry, while sleeping, hurriedly lands in his headquarters)
Carl: Uh, hi, Agent P. Major Monogram isn't here right now, but he left this note. (Tries to mimic Major Monogram's voice) "Dear Carl, I haven't been kidnapped so don't come looking for him... I mean me." Kinda weird, though, that he took the time to cut each letter out of a magazine. Anyway, Doof is on vacation with his daughter in Tokyo right now which is where the Annual World Good Guy convention is being held, and Major Monogram is the keynote speaker. Coincidence? 100% yes! So I guess you got the day off!
(Back in the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Stacy: All right, you got your breakfast. What's eating you?
Candace: Well, you know how Jeremy's in France for another week?
Stacy: Yeah, so?
Candace: Do you know what they have in France?
Stacy: The pyramids?
Candace: No! French girls!
Stacy: Come on, Candace. Everybody knows that you and Jeremy are an item.
Candace: Not officially... He's never even called me his girlfriend. We've never even kissed! That means Jeremy's single, in Paris, and surrounded by French girls. I'm no fool, Stacy, I've seen the oil paintings.
Stacy: Candace, you got to believe in yourself. What do French girls have that you don't have?
Candace: At the moment, Jeremy.
Stacy: Candace, if you want him to call you his girlfriend, maybe you should call him your boyfriend.
Candace: I can do that? I can use the B-word first?
Stacy: Sure, why not?
Candace: Oh, and Stacy, pyramids? Really?
Stacy: Oh, right. That's Belgium, isn't it?
(Scene shifts to Doofenshmirtz and Vanessa)
Vanessa: Look at this, it says that the tallest structure in Tokyo is the Tokyo Tower. And it even looks like the Eiffel Tower!
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: See? It's just like we're in France! Oh, here's my bag now!
Vanessa: I can't believe you brought work with you!
(Doofenshmirtz's "bag" is revealed to be Major Monogram tied up to a cart)
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: What do you mean?
Vanessa: Dad, you've got some guy tied up in here.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: No, no, Vanessa. We've got some guy tied up in here.
Major Monogram: I've got a name, you know.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: All right. Vanessa, Major Monogram. Major Monogram, Vanessa. There, you happy now?!
Major Monogram: I've never been happy.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Come on, let's go get a taxi.
Major Monogram: I'd prefer a town car.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Quiet, you!
(Scene shifts to the backyard)
Phineas: Okay, we're getting a slight late start because of the broken wing, but here's the whole route. With stops in Tokyo and Paris to refuel.
Isabella: You're going to Paris?
Phineas: Yeah, wanna come?
Isabella: To the City of Love?
Phineas: (Obliviously) That's what they call it.
Isabella: You're asking me to go to the City of Love with you?
Phineas: Yeah, it'll be fun.
Isabella: Now, let me see if I got this straight...
Buford: Hey Dinner Bell! I'm goin' with you to make sure you don't cheat.
Phineas: Okay. So Baljeet, you wanna come too?
Baljeet: Well, naturally--
Buford: I get one carry-on.
Phineas: All right. Carry on, then. Did you get that wing fixed yet?
Chaka Khan: I guess so. We pretty much used up all the packing tape.
Phineas: Okay, the clock is ticking, everyone!(Candace comes outside, ripping through the map)
Candace: Phineas! What's going on here?
Phineas: We're flying around the world to make the longest, funnest day of summer ever.
Candace: Oh, no, no, no. Mom left me in charge, and I say you and your little friends are not going anywhere--
Stacy: Hey, Candace, check out this giant map!
Candace: (Looks at the map) You're going to Paris...? France?
Phineas: That's the plan. We'll have to stop and refuel.
Candace: (There's a short silence while she thinks before she gets a determined look on her face) Like I was saying, you and your little friends are not going anywhere...without me!
Stacy: No, no, no, no, Candace! This is a bad idea! About as bad as you've ever had in a loong line, and I love you when you say this, really, really bad ideas.
Candace: Stacy, they're going to Paris! Where Jeremy is!
Stacy: You promised your mom you'd keep your brothers out of trouble.
Candace: What better way to look after them than by going along and keeping them out of trouble along the way?
Stacy: You realize that's a massive rationalization, don't you?
Candace: Oh yeah, totally.
Stacy: Well, say hi to Jeremy for me! And hey, you should stop by and see my cousins in Tokyo!
Phineas: Ferb, did you get the giant map packed?
(Ferb taps his pocket)
Phineas: Wow, mad folding skills. You guys all ready?
Buford: Ready for you to lose!
(They start engine)
Phineas: Uh, Ferb?
(The camera pans out to reveal their house is blocking the way. Ferb clicks a button, lowering the house down into the ground)
Phineas: All right, everyone, make sure your tray tables are stowed and your seats are in their full and up--
(The airplane takes off in fast speed. The house rises again and the backyard is a mess from the take-off)
Adyson: Okay, girls. We have roughly forty hours to get this backyard in line and set up for the party. Let's go, go, go!
Clay Aiken: Who left her in charge?
Adyson: Here, make yourself useful. (hands him a rake)
Clay Aiken: (Stares) You know, we're only booked for the hour!

Act II
Scene opens with the Amazing Sunbeater 3000 flying over a body of water.
Phineas: So, what did you guys think of the Pacific Ocean?
Buford: Eh, probably like my fifth favorite ocean.
Phineas: Next stop: Tokyo!
(Switches to a view of Tokyo Tower, with Vanessa and Doofenshmirtz)
Vanessa: It says here that the Tokyo Tower is the tallest self-supporting steel structure in the world!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, look down there, that guy just fell off his bike.
Vanessa: But..it says nothing about a...giant water balloon.
(The Tokyo Tower is seen again but reveals a giant water balloon hanging from the top)
Vanessa: (Suspiciously) Dad?
Doofenshmirtz: Do you like it?
Vanessa: We're supposed to be on vacation.
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, we'll be on our way as soon as Major Monogram drops this water balloon on the entire International Good Guy convention.
Major Monogram: I would never pull an elaborate childish prank like that. It would ruin my reputation! Destroy my credita- oh, I see where you're going with this.
Doofenshmirtz: Yes! And best of all, without your leadership, it will totally put an end to the...yes... What's the name of your organization again?
Major Monogram: The O.W.C.A. The Organization Without a Cool Acronym.
Doofenshmirtz: Okay. Well I'm going to put an end to Ah-ooh-CA, I guess...? Wow, that really isn't a cool acronym.
Major Monogram: Told ya.
(Back with the plane)
Phineas: Ladies and gentlemen, Tokyo, Japan.
Candace: Hey, Stacy has family down there. We should visit.
Phineas: We're one step ahead of you, Candace.
Candace: (screams)
Phineas: Here we are!
(The plane lowers down and starts dragging against the road until it comes to a complete stop)
Phineas: Whoops. (He clicks a button and the landing wheels pop out) I thought it sounded a little grindy and sparky.
(Ferb approaches an old woman)
Ferb: Kon'nichiwa! Suteishī no tomodachi desu! ("Hello! We are friends of Stacy!")
Bāchan Hirano: Hey, everybody! Phineas and Ferb are here!
(A gong is heard as a ton of people run out of a nearby house joining them)
Phineas: Wow! Stacy sure has a lot of cousins.
(Song: "J-Pop (Welcome to Tokyo)")
Cousins: ♪ Welcome to Tokyo ♪
♪ Being glad that you are here ♪
♪ We came visiting, Delightful us ♪
♪ Welcome to Tokyo ♪
Phineas: Hey, do you guys have any vegetable oil we can use? We need to refuel.
Cousin: Oh, sure. Obaachan owns a tempura restaurant.
♪ As for a list of exotic amusements ♪
♪ We choice between the summer there ♪
♪ It is here we look at baseball ♪
♪ Like the fact that it does ♪
♪ As some people the fact ♪
♪ That volleyball is done and is enjoyed ♪
♪ When it's hot we swim in water ♪
♪ Like the fact that it goes ♪
(The group gets back on the plane, still doing the Caramelldansen)
Phineas: Thanks a lot! We'll say hi to Stacy for you! (The plane takes off, and everyone is still dancing) Man, Tokyo's a fun town!
Candace: I have no idea what just happened.
(Back at Tokyo Tower)
Major Monogram: No one in the Agency will ever believe that I dropped that water balloon.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, they will. Because you're going to confess that you did it on-camera for the world to see!
Major Monogram: You can't make me talk. I have nerves of steel and...an iron will and...gold teeth and a...copper spleen. Basically, I'm 35% metal.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, man. It must be hard getting through the airport.
Major Monogram: Oh, don't get me started. Anyway, you can't make me talk.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh yeah? (Puts his fingers on the Major's mouth as if he's the one talking) "I am Major Monogram. I dropped that water balloon. I have poopy pants." Eh?
Major Monogram: Well. I stand corrected. That's actually very convincing.
Vanessa: Dad! This entire trip has been about your work! That's it! If you don't want to spend time with me, then I don't want to spend time with you.
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa! Where are you going?
Vanessa: I'm going to the airport and I'm flying to Paris. (Perry lands beside her) Hey, Perry. (to Doofenshmirtz) Alone if I have to!
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa, wait! (Vanessa stops) You have all the traveler's checks.
Vanessa: Traveler's checks? Really?!
Doofenshmirtz: Ohh, did I say traveler's checks? Uhh, no, no... I do wanna spend time with you... Ohh look, look. I'll drop the water balloon right now and... (gets kicked by Perry)
(The remote hits Major Monogram before dropping on the ground and breaking, the button on it beginning to blink)
Major Monogram: Cheese and crackers! Oh, excuse me, you two... But uh...is that button supposed to be blinking like that?
Doofenshmirtz: Yep! That means it's working!
(The water balloon starts swinging from where it's attached on the top of the tower)
Vanessa: Ohh, this can't be good. (She gets hit by the water balloon and falls)
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa! NOO!
(She shouts as she falls before she's caught by Phineas and Ferb's plane)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, they caught her! They caught her!
(Vanessa pulls herself away from the glass and sees Ferb on the plane)
Vanessa: Ferb?
Ferb: Vanessa?
Phineas: No matter where we go, Ferb knows everyone.
(Ferb lets her in)
Vanessa: Thanks, guys.
Phineas: It's a good thing we came along when we did. So where do we drop you?
Vanessa: I don't know. Where are you guys going?
Phineas: Well, we're off to Paris to refuel then back to Danville.
Vanessa: Can I just come with you?
Phineas: Sure.
(The plane continues on and Doofenshmirtz watches from the Tower)
Doofenshmirtz: Wait, wait, wait... You saved her and now you're running off with her like...? OH! I have very mixed feelings about you! (to Perry) Uh... Perry the Platypus, how did you get here? I-I need a ride. Could you guys help me out?
Major Monogram: You're kidding, right?
Doofenshmirtz: No! I have to save my daughter. This is a big deal! Oh please? Please please? Oh, please please-y weasy please please? Please?
Major Monogram: Fine. But after we get her back, you're going to answer for what you've done here, mister.
Doofenshmirtz: Wait, what? You were coming here, anyway, and... (He accidentally steps on the button and water balloon is released from the rope holding it to the tower and flies up into the sky) Oh, and uh... As far as flinging that water balloon into orbit, hehheh... (puts his fingers on Major Monogram's mouth again) "I did that."
Major Monogram: Seriously. When was the last time you washed your hands?
(Back with the Sunbeater 3000)
Phineas: OK, everybody! Keep an eye out for Klimpaloon!
Candace: Klimpaloon?
Phineas: Yeah, Klimpaloon! The magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas!
Candace: You're making that up.
Phineas: Come on Candace, does that sound like something someone would make up?
(Beeping sound comes from the altitude meter)
Candace: What's that?
Phineas: Uh oh, we didn't calculate for the weight of an extra body.
Candace: Will this affect our arrival in Paris?
Phineas: Hmm... let me let you know in about two seconds.
(Wings of the plane are broken off within two seconds)
Phineas: Candace?
Candace: Yeah?
Phineas: It IS going to affect our arrival in Paris!
(The Sun-Beater crashes, and Klimpaloon shuffles past.)
Klimpaloon: NANG NANG NANG NANG NANG NANG NANG NANG!
Phineas: And you thought I'd made it up!
(On Perry's hovercraft)
Major Monogram: Do you even have any idea where we're supposed to be going?
Doofenshmirtz: Fortunately, Vanessa's wearing the earrings I got her. They're made out of these cool little tracking devices. Look, see; the signal's not too far away but it's on the move. Thataway! Woohoo! Team Doofenshmirtz, go! (Perry and Major Monogram glare) What? Like I'm going to let you name the team? Organization Without a Cool Acronym?

(At the Himalayas)
Buford: Well, looks like you're gonna lose!
Baljeet: Hey! I believe my Uncle Sabu lives not far from here! Perhaps he can help!
Phineas: Cool! Come on, let's go!
Candace: Forget it. I'm staying with the plane.
Vanessa: And I'll keep her company.
Phineas: Okay. Back in a few.
Vanessa: So Candace, what is Ferb short for?
Candace: I...don't...know.
(With the kids)
Baljeet: He is home!
Uncle Sabu: Ah, Baljeet and friends, I was expecting you.
Baljeet: Really?
Uncle Sabu: No, that's just something we say up here to freak out the tourists.
Phineas: Uhh, Uncle Sabu, do you live up here?
Uncle Sabu: Yes, it's quite a trek, isn't it? It used to be very inconvenient for me. But then I built my factory up here, and now it's inconvenient for everyone else!
Phineas: What do you make here?
Uncle Sabu: Ohh, wait for it. There's a whole musical number.

Act III
(Scene opens with Vanessa and Candace standing at the base of a mountain, looking at their phones.)
Candace: Ugh, I've got like...no bars here.
Vanessa: Let's see if we get a signal further up the mountain.
(On Perry's hovercraft)
Doofenshmirtz: I got her! She's down there on that craggy mountain. Quick! Let's land this bird.
Major Monogram: The terrain is too treacherous. You're going to have to parachute. Here's your parachute, goggles and oxygen mask.
Doofenshmirtz: Wow, you have everything. How about a nice cup of hot co... (The seat ejects him) COOOOOOO!!! (Doofenshmirtz lands on the mountain and begins to roll down, gathering snow and accidentally making a giant snowball)
(With Vanessa and Candace)
Vanessa: Do you hear a...rumbling noise?
(Back with the kids where a giant rubber band ball is attached to the bottom of the plane)
Phineas: So, as soon as Candace and Vanessa get here, we can...
Candace: (She and Vanessa are running from the giant snowball while Candace shouts) Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane!
Phineas: Ferb, I think we may wanna start the plane.
(Ferb tries to start the plane but it won't start)
Candace: Start the PLANE! Start the plane! Start the PLAAANE!
Phineas: Sounds like you're flooding it...
Ferb: I'm not flooding it!
Candace: Start the plaaane!
(Vanessa gets caught by the snowball and gets flung towards the plane)
Phineas: INCOMING!
(Ferb provides a safe landing for Vanessa when he clicks a button and causes a seat to rise up and catch her)
Candace: Start the plane! Start the PLANE! (She trips over a small hill, causing the snowball to miss her) Huh?
(The snowball hits the plane and falls down a cliff)
Candace: No, no, no! How am I ever going to explain this to Mom?!
Klimpaloon: (passes by) NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG! NANG!
Candace: That's NOT helping!
Klimpaloon: (walks away scared) NANG... NANG... NANG... NANG...
(The plane bounces back up again)
Phineas: Candace! Hop on! (Candace gets on) All right! Hold on to something!
(The plane zooms off, and the snowball flies off of it)
(The giant snowball lands beside Perry's hovercraft and the snow falls off, revealing Doofenshmirtz)
Major Monogram: So, how'd it go?
(The plane bounces off all around the world)

Phineas: We're all out of rubber bands... But the good news is we're gonna crash into Paris.
Candace: How is that good news?
Phineas: Huh? I thought you wanted to go to Paris?
Candace: Oh yeah, I did.
(The plane falls; everyone screams)
Candace: I'm feeling very conflicted about this!!
(The Sunbeater 3000 lands in the Seine River)

Act IV
Scene opens with the gang in the Sunbeater 3000, most of the group look a bit messed up from the crash.
Phineas: All right gang, we made it to Paris. We need fuel and parts so we need to split up.
Buford: Yeah, my pants are way ahead of ya.
(Back on Perry's hovercraft)
Doofenshmirtz: According to this sdƃ, Vanessa's in some place called sıɹɐd. Hmm...
(Perry turns over the GPS)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, Paris! That makes a lot more sense. That's actually where she wanted to go. Good for her.
(Back in Paris)
Phineas: Okay, everybody, let's get going. Candace, you go see Jeremy.
Candace: Way ahead of ya! (She runs off)
Phineas: Baljeet and Buford, you guys go scare up the fuel we need.
Buford: You're still gonna lose, but do I like scaring things.
Phineas: Ferb, why don't you go to the Eiffel Tower and get a reading on the trade winds?
Vanessa: (Drives up on a scooter) Hop on!
Phineas: Vanessa, you rented a scooter!
Vanessa: Uhh, yeah. Rented. (Ferb gets on and the two head for the Eiffel Tower)
Phineas: I'm going to go see if I can go find some parts. Isabella, you want to come with me?
Isabella: YES! I mean, yeah, sure, you know, whatever. It's all good, bro.
(Back with Candace...)
Candace: Okay. Jeremy's staying in the hotel La Poubelle. La Poubelle, La Poubelle, La Poubelle... (She sees a woman) Oh, pardonaise-moi, madam.
Woman: Oui?
(Candace pulls out a French-English dictionary)
Candace: Une moment. Can you tell me... Oh, "Pouvaise-vous me dire" uh...
Woman: Can I tell you directions? It's okay, I speak English.
Candace: Yes. I speak English. Parlais anglais. Uh, ou est la Hotel Poubelle?
Woman: It's just around the corner.
Candace: Ugh, around the corner, around the corner, "oh quan de la rou-ee?"
Woman: Oui.
Candace: Oh, never mind. I'll find it myself. (She turns the corner and sees the hotel) Hey, Hotel Poubelle! It was just around the corner! (She sees Jeremy) There he is! Jer -- (She stops when she sees Jeremy talking and having fun with some French kids. She looks depressed before walking away. A mime appears where she was previously standing, letting go of a balloon)
(With Phineas and Isabella)
Isabella: So Phineas, what do you think of the City of Love?
Phineas: I wish it was the City of Airplane Parts.
Isabella: Oh, you're just too stressed. You should take a moment to relax and enjoy it.

(The mime passes by and lets go of a balloon)
Vendor: Hey you! Stop letting my balloons go!
(With Baljeet and Buford...)
Baljeet: Now Buford, your mindless bullying may have a rustic charm stateside, but now we are in Europe. A place of high refinement. So let me do all the talking. (They go inside a restaurant and speaks with a man in a different accent) Excuse me, sir. Would you have any used cooking oil that we could have?
Man: Non.
Baljeet: Ohh, the French are so intimidating!
Buford: Out of my way, runt.
Baljeet: Do not do anything too crazy!
Buford: (Cracks his fingers) Excusez-moi mon bon monsieur. Auriez-vous par hazard un soupçon d'huile de cuisson que nous pourrions utiliser sans nous démerder un sou? (Excuse me, good sir. Would you by chance have a touch of cooking oil that we could use without losing a penny?)
Man: But of course.
(Baljeet stares in disbelief at Buford, who quickly notices)
Buford: (to Baljeet) Not one word about that to the others.
(Phineas stares deeply at a bread store as a man is taking some giant, fake baguettes off of the front)
Phineas: Pardonnez-moi, monsieur, are you throwing those away?
Man: C'est les ordres.
Isabella: This is about the plane, isn't it?
Phineas: Well yeah, what else?
Isabella: Well, I guess we'll always have giant plastic baguettes.
(On top of Eiffel Tower)
Vanessa: I don't know, Ferb. I know he's my dad and I shouldn't blame him for being busy, it's just that...he always seems to put his work ahead of me. (She sighs) I just don't know what to do.
Ferb: Well, sometimes if you love somebody, you have to meet them halfway.
Vanessa: Halfway, huh? Hmm. (Ferb looks and sees a flower shop as she's talking) You mean like, maybe I should take an interest in his work? I would but, it's actually evil. I just can't... (She looks to see Ferb is gone) Ferb?
(Doofenshmirtz arrives and is near Vanessa)
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa! We've come to rescue you!
Vanessa: Dad? I was just gonna... Wait. What do you mean "we"?
Doofenshmirtz: I hitched a ride! You remember these guys, don't you?
Major Monogram: Hello again, young lady.
Vanessa: I can't believe you brought work with you again!
Doofenshmirtz: Work? What do you... Oh, you mean them? No, Major Monobrow and Perry the Platypus, they...they were helping me find you!
Major Monogram: Monobrow?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, come on. You've got that whole thing up here, it runs right... It's one straight line, for crying out loud!
Major Monogram: That's it. I'm getting my tweezers back from Carl.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, come on, Vanessa. I came halfway around the world to get you!
Vanessa: Halfway?
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, halfway around the world.
Vanessa: You met me halfway.
Doofenshmirtz: I suppose you could put it that way.
(Vanessa and Doofenshmirtz smile at each other)
Vanessa: You did, didn't you? You know what Dad, move over. I'm coming with you.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, this is great, Vanessa! Why don't we talk to these guys for giving us a tour in Paris? We could go check out the Guillotine Museum!
Major Monogram: Gross.
(Ferb comes back to with a rose in hand, and sees Vanessa flying off with Doofenshmirtz)
Vanessa: Bye, Ferb! Thanks for everything!
(With Phineas, Isabella, Baljeet and Buford. Buford and Baljeet are fixing the boat while Phineas and Isabella stand nearby)
Phineas: Well, the baguettes are rubber banded on. That should get us across the Atlantic. Why didn't we think of that in the first place?
Isabella: (sarcastically) Gee, I don't know.
(Ferb shows up)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb. Where's Vanessa?
Ferb: She went off with someone else.
Phineas: That's too bad. I thought the two of you, you know, a boy, a girl, alone in the City of Love. I thought romance was a forgone conclusion.
Isabella: Grrrr! (Isabella looks on in surprise as he says this before finally breaking her pencil in anger)
Phineas: (Obviously) Isabella, did you say something?
Isabella: (Annoyed) I need a new pencil.
(Ferb hands her another pencil when Candace comes back)
Phineas: Oh, hey, Candace. So how'd it go? Did you see Jeremy?
Candace: Well, I saw him. I just didn't talk to him.
Phineas: Oh, that's too bad. I thought, you know, the two of you, a boy, a girl, alone in the City of Love...
Isabella: Grrrr! (Isabella reacts the same way as before but instead of breaking her pencil, her head explodes)
Phineas: Isabella?!
(Shows that she's fine and it was just a dream)
Phineas: Isabella, are you okay?
Isabella: (annoyed) Peachy.
Phineas: So, what happened?
Candace: Well, you know when you know someone, and you see that they have another, like, life away from you and it feels weird?
Phineas: Like when you see your teacher in the grocery store weird? Or like when someone you've known for a long time starts wearing a cowboy hat weird?
Candace: The...the first thing weird.
Phineas: That's good. 'Cause I was thinking about getting the cowboy hat.
Candace: It's just... Jeremy looked like he was having a really good time here. And it suddenly seem creepy and obsessive that I came all this way. What if he doesn't wanna see me? Or came to Paris to get away from me?
Phineas: Candace, like the song said, you have to believe you can!
Baljeet: I think Candace may have missed that song.
Buford: Yeah, man, she was in the house!
Phineas: What?! You missed Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan?!
Candace: Uhh...apparently.
Phineas: Well, that's too bad. But the jist of it was that you gotta believe in yourself.
Candace: Well, that's easy for you, Phineas! Look at all the things you've done. Summer belongs to you.
Phineas: Summer doesn't belong to me. It belongs to everyone! And that includes you. You have to believe that.
Candace: Well, my summer's been a series of failures. (Sadly) I have a hard time believing in anything.
Phineas: Well...you got on this plane. You know, back when it WAS a plane. Which means you believe in us!
Ferb: And we believe in you.
Phineas: And therefore, through the transitive property of belief, you do believe in yourself!
Candace: I do?
Phineas: Besides, when we did all those things, you were right there with us!
Candace: I was, wasn't I?
Phineas: Yes! You're Candace Flynn! Monster truck driver. Charioteer. Queen of Mars!
Candace: Well, I am Candace Flynn.
Phineas: That's the spirit!
Candace: You're right. I'm Candace Flynn! Lifeguard!
Phineas: That's right, Candace!
Candace: (She starts climbing on the plane) Time traveler!
Phineas: Don't break the engine!
Candace: (She stands on top of the engine before shouting) I am Candace Flynn! Cou de Crayon!
(Jeremy appears on the bridge overhead)
Jeremy: Candace?
Candace: Jeremy?!
Jeremy: It is you! I was just over there in the taxi and I saw you over... What are you doing here?
Candace: Well, my brothers have this idea of flying over...
Jeremy: Your brothers? Say no more.
Phineas: Oops, we slipped our mooring. Guess we're leaving. Hey Candace, better wrap it up! Looks like we're on our way.
Candace: What? No, not yet! I have something I wanted to tell you!
Jeremy: Really, what is it?
Candace: I wanted to tell you earlier but then I saw you in front of your hotel, with those kids, and the girl with the ice cream...
Jeremy: Candace, were you spying on me?
Candace: No, no, it's just that I saw you and it was like...it was like my teacher wearing a cowboy hat!
Jeremy: I would hope my girlfriend would have a little trust in me.
Candace: (Shocked) Jeremy... You said the G-word!
Jeremy: Well, yeah, I used the...oh...ugh, hold on! (He runs to the opposite side of the bridge) Yeah, I used the G-word. It doesn't freak you out, does it?
Candace: No, because I think of you as my B-word.
Jeremy: Well, G-word. You want a K-word?
Candace: Heheheh, maybe?
(The two try to kiss but the plane continues to slowly drift away)
Jeremy: Uhh...Candace?
Candace: All set, Jeremy! Start kissin'!
Jeremy: Candace...!
Candace: (Opens her eyes and sees that he's too far away) No, no, no, no, no, no!
Jeremy: W-Wait, you can't leave now! You would...just get off on the next bridge!
Candace: I can't, I'm in charge of these guys. I-I gotta be responsible. I'll see you in a week, boyfriend!
Phineas: Candace, you better take your seat.
Isabella: Don't worry, Candace. The week will be over before you know it. (A bit bitterly) At least you got a love scene on a bridge.
Buford: "Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by the imagination."
Baljeet: Voltaire, Buford? Really?
Buford: Oh, I can't help it. Paris does it to me every time.
Phineas: It's four o'clock, we're on a baguette boat, with a fuel tank filled with snail grease. I have a good feeling about this. Okay everyone, hold on to something!
(The Sunbeater as a boat zooms away)
Phineas: Ohohoh, YEEAH!
Mime: (Gets splashed by water as the plane zooms past) Hey everyone! I can talk!
Phineas: We're almost to Le Havre harbour, Ferb. After that, it's nothing but an open ocean and a couple of remote islands! We should be home in no time! (He notices a huge ship blocking the way) Huh, well that might be a problem.
Doofenshmirtz: (On the hovercraft) Hey, check it out! It's my giant water balloon!
(The balloon crashes and creates a giant wave that lets the baguette boat pass over the ship, zooming away)

Sailor 1: Would you look at that. Five kids in a jet-powered baguette boat in the middle of the Atlantic.

(Song continuation:)
♪ Gonna follow the sun ♪
Phineas: Well, looks like everything worked out the best! That giant wave put us back on schedule. We may even arrive in Danville ahead of time. You know, barring any foreseen mishaps. (The stirring wheel suddenly breaks off) Oh, like that. That's what I'm talking about. (The engine breaks) And that. (Another part breaks off) And that. (The baguettes fall off) And that. (Everything breaks except for the seats) This is all exactly what I was talking about earlier.

Act V
(Scene opens up with The Sunbeater 3000 on a remote island.)
Phineas: Well, Ferb, that was our worst landing yet. I'm beginning to detect a pattern here.
Candace: Phineas! This isn't Danville; it's a deserted island! The only things on this island are us, a couple of trees and a big fat ox!
Buford: Hey!
Candace: Not you big fat ox, him big fat ox.
(The Ox is saddened by Candace's comment)
Candace: When Mom and Dad left me in charge, I never took into account that we might not make it back at all! Now we're stranded, and now I'll never get my kiss from Jeremy! (She starts crying and falls to her knees) It's the end of romance! Aaagh! (She curls into a ball on the ground)
Buford: (Laughs) You're gonna lose!
Phineas: You do realize that you're stranded on this island too, right?
Buford: I don't care, I'm winning! (He laughs some more) I'm done.
Baljeet: Phineas, how are we going to get off this island?
Phineas: Well, we'll just have to fix the boat!
Candace: (Hopelessly) With what?
Phineas: There's plenty here. All we need is our imagination! For instance, we could tie those two palm trees into a raft and add a super sonic outboard motor. Oh, wait...we don't have anything to cut the trees with and...we don't have an outboard motor. (He looks at the ox) Aaah, I know, we could soup up this ox so he could run on a conveyor belt that would charge the... Ohh, we don't have a conveyor belt and we don't have any soup.
Buford: Not to mention... You're never gonna make it!
Phineas: We'll make it! After all, we've got... Uhh... (He looks around) We've got the seats! We've still got one rubber band! And we've got... (He looks at the ground after seeing nothing else before he picks up handfuls of sand) We've got sand!
Buford: Hey, maybe you could make an hourglass and watch the time slip away.
(Back in Paris)
Doofenshmirtz: Well, thanks for the lift.
Major Monogram: Before you leave, we have one more thing for you.
Doofenshmirtz: Really? What is it?
(Perry handcuffs Doofenshmirtz)
Major Monogram: Those are handcuffs.
Doofenshmirtz: I know what handcuffs are. I'm not an idiot! (to Perry) And not one word outta you.
Major Monogram: Well, there's a list of outstanding violations as long as your arm.
Doofenshmirtz: Ohh, well, I do have unusually long arms.
Vanessa: But we're on vacation!
Major Monogram: Oh, don't worry young lady. You'll be able to continue your vacation in 10–20 years.
Doofenshmirtz: I'm gonna beat the rap, though. I've been working on a rap-beat-inator. I just don't know if it works in France. I mean, if you see the electrical outlets here, I wouldn't even know where to start.
Vanessa: Hold it right there! (She holds up what looks like a ray of some sort) Step away from the evil scientist!
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa! I'm so proud of you! You are evil!
(They commandeer Perry's hovercraft)
Vanessa: I'm not evil. Just get in the car before they find out this is only a hair dryer.
(They take off)
Doofenshmirtz: This is a hair dryer?
Vanessa: Yeah. I got it in Tokyo.
Doofenshmirtz: Cool! But they didn't know it was a hair dryer when you pointed it at them, so...that means you're little evil!
Vanessa: Okay, Dad. Maybe I'm a little evil.
Doofenshmirtz: I knew it! (He cries in joy) That's okay... I'm not gonna cry...
Vanessa: Dad.
Major Monogram: Well, guess we could kiss that pair of handcuffs good bye. I don't about you, but I'm gonna go take in a review. See you back in the States.
(He leaves Perry behind)
(Back on the island Phineas is seen in a giant hole digging with hands)
Phineas: (Desperately) There, There's got to be some minerals or something down here that we can use! I mean, we can't...we can't just be stuck here!
(Isabella walks away and cries until Ferb comes and gives her a handkerchief)
Isabella: Thanks, Ferb. I just don't know what to do, I mean...we were in Paris! The most romantic city in the world, and... (She sobs) he didn't even notice me! (She blows in the handkerchief) I just feel like giving up, and look at him!
(Phineas' head appears out of the hole he'd been digging, holding up a yellow sponge and a pink starfish)
Phineas: Look! A sponge and a starfish! There's gotta be something we can make out of this! Ah! Oh no, that's ridiculous! (He tosses them before going back down in the hole)
Isabella: It's as if I don't exist! I would give anything if he would just sit down with me and enjoy this beautiful sunset.
(Ferb walks away and Phineas runs over to her)
Phineas: (Desperately) We, we, we could—We, we we could dig a tunnel under the ocean and then we could, uh, we could...we can, we can...we...we can't. I can't...I can't believe there's nothing we can do to get off of this... (He sighs before he sits beside Isabella and says sadly) I guess at least we can sit and watch this beautiful sunset.
(Isabella stares at him for a second, realizing something)
Isabella: No.
Phineas: What?
Isabella: (She stands) No, you are not going to enjoy this beautiful sunset!
Phineas: I'm not?
Isabella: You built a rollercoaster through downtown! You made giant tree-house robots! You traveled through time for crying out loud! Twice!
Phineas: But, Isabella, there's nothing here for me to work with.
Isabella: Well, that's not the Phineas Flynn that I fell in...(She pauses, and quickly rephrases what she was going to say) to...this...situation with. You showed us all in Ferb's map how this is possible and I'm not gonna let you sit there and --
Phineas: Ferb's map! (He jumps up) That's it! Isabella, you're the best! (He hugs her before turning to Ferb, unknowingly leaving Isabella in a trance) Hey Ferb. Let's see that map again.
(Ferb unfolds the map and covers the whole island)
Phineas: Okay. We're here, and we need to go there. And we've got about... I'd say eleven minutes. Isabella, grab Madagascar and bring it over here to Ohio. Now Candace, you grab the Andes and fold it over the Main Greenland.
Candace: You know, folding the map doesn't actually make these places closer together.
Phineas: I know, I know! Crease it here. Buford, Australia over to Africa. Baljeet, Hawaii to Japan. (Baljeet pulls the map) No, no, East, East! Don't go West, you'll rip it! All right...now fold it here. Buford, one more crease down this line.
Candace: Phineas.. I don't see how an origami unicorn is getting us off this island!
Phineas: It's not done yet, it needs one more fold. (He makes the last fold) There you go! Now wait...
(The map turns into a monster, a Ferris wheel and finally a paper airplane)
Candace: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! There's no way I'm getting on that plane!
Phineas: Wait, wait. It's gonna work, you'll see!
Isabella: I think it's beautiful.
Candace: Don't encourage him. (to Phineas) Phineas, this is crazy!
Phineas: (He grabs the rubber band and puts it around the two trees) Car-salesman crazy or mattress-salesman crazy?
Candace: I don't know... Neither!
Phineas: That's a relief. Isabella, Baljeet, get the seats!
Isabella: You got it!
Phineas: Buford, grab the ox!
Buford: (Lifting the ox) This is the only way I'll actually hold him.
Candace: Phineas, it's made of paper!
Phineas: So was the Declaration of Independence!
Candace: Yeah, but it wouldn't fly over 2,000 miles of water! Buford, why are you helping?
Buford: (carrying the ox) How often do you get to lift an ox?
Candace: Have I taken crazy pills?! There's no engine!
Phineas: True, but we do have this rubber band made of super special den-si-ty!
Isabella: Just believe we can, Candace!
Baljeet: Yes. Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan cannot both be wrong.
Candace: Look, apparently I missed some big musical number with Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan, okay? So can we please stop using that as a reference?!
Baljeet: Well, it was just very inspirational.
Candace: I'm not getting on that plane!
Phineas: Candace, you won't see Jeremy again 'till we get off the island.
Candace: (She thinks) I get a window seat!
(The ox pulls the plane backward, stretching the rubber band)
Buford: You know, my horoscope said I would be riding an ox today. But I thought that was a figure of speech!
Phineas: A little bit further... A little bit further... Okay, that'll have to do. We're almost out of time; everybody on the plane!
(Everyone gets on)
Phineas: Everyone ready? It's now or never!
Candace: Actually Phineas, I-I changed my mind. I wanna stay here.
Phineas: Oh, that's just the mortal terror talking.
Candace: Well, yeah...that's what I was...
Phineas: Buford, pull the release!
Buford: Whatever, dude. It's not gonna --
(The paper plane zooms off towards America's east coast, everybody screams)
Phineas: It's working! Look!
Buford: Yes, yes, yes!
Baljeet: What are you so happy about?
Buford: I finally ate a bug!
Phineas: It looks like we're gonna make it! There's the Tri-State Area!
(Cut to the park)
Substitute teacher announcer: Welcome to the 27th annual Substitute Teacher Day. We begin by...
(The paper plane passes him)
Substitute teacher announcer: All right, who's the wise guy?
Phineas: Hang on, everyone! We're coming in!
(The paper airplane crashes)
Phineas: Actually, that's probably our best landing of the day. Great, the sun's still up and we're only five blocks away. Come on!
(They see the road construction)
Isabella: Oh no! Road construction!
Phineas: It took mom an hour get around that ditch!
Isabella: There's only 58 seconds 'til sundown!
Baljeet: What kind of watch is that?
Buford: No, no, no! Ohh, I actually thought we're gonna make it! I thought we were gonna do the impossible. For one shining moment...summer was whatever I wanted to make of it! Wait...this is my house! Hold on one second! I'm givin' everybody back their bikes!!
Phineas: But Buford, we didn't make it back to our yard. (Sees a ramp on the construction) I get it! Everybody, get your bikes!
(Getting the bikes)
Buford: Here's Ferb's, here's Phineas's, here's Isabella's... And here's, uh... A recumbent? Really?
Baljeet: Studies say it is better for your back.
Buford: How come I don't have to stand in line to bully you?
Candace: Wait, Buford never took my bike.
Buford: Noted.
Phineas: There's one right there!
Candace: Phineas, I'm not gonna get on a silly little tricycle.
Phineas: Candace, we're in a hurry. Just get on the trike, and we'll...
Candace: There's no way I'm gonna--
Phineas: (angrily) GET ON THE TRIKE!!!
(Everyone pedals their way toward the ramp)
Candace: Phineas, there's no way we're gonna clear that!
Phineas: Just believe we can, Candace!
Candace: Is that another Chaka Khan reference? Because I thought I was clear...
Phineas: You don't have to hear the song, Candace, you just have to believe!
Isabella: I believe!
Baljeet: I believe!
Buford: I believe!
(Ferb thumbs up)
Candace: Okay...I belieeeeeeve!!
(They fly on the air)
(In the car)
Linda: What a long day. It seem like the sun would never go down.
(In the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Ginger: Where are they?
Gretchen: Don't worry, they'll make it.
Milly: Seven seconds 'till sundown!
Holly: Maybe it'll help if we count!
Fireside Girls: Five! Four! Three! Two!
(Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Isabella, Baljeet, and Buford land in the yard)
Phineas: ONE!

Singers: ♪ Cause you believe we can... ♪
Phineas: Yeah! We did it! Oh my gosh, that was so great!

Linda: Oh, for us? That is so nice. And Candace, so responsible. Not a single phone call.
Candace: Well, I didn't have international coverage.
Linda: What?
Candace: Never mind!
Linda: Anyway, the party looks great. But you would not believe what a long day we've had. I think we're gonna turn in early.
Lawrence: You guys just enjoy the party, okay?
