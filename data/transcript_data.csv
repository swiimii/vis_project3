doofenshmirtz,see during my teen years i was very adept at hand shadows. it was great for entertaining at parties and for meeting fräuleins. but then one day there was a new puppeteer in town. his name was hans and his hands were huge. we called him huge hands hans. his puppetry was garbage but unfortunately it was good enough for my fräulein. i lost her to a boy with bigger fingers and i never did a shadow puppet again.,season_1,44,16,91

phineas,we were wearing helmets. ,season_1,45,18,70
sergeant,don't worry. your boys will be in good hands. as you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure the smile away reformatory offers a serene peaceful environment in which safety discipline and responsibility are encouraged. your boys will be whipped into shape in no time.,season_1,45,18,71
phineas,well i'll be honest ferb i didn't see this coming. baljeet? what are you doing here?,season_1,45,18,72

sergeant,okay listen up maggots! you are here because your parents are worried about you. now the way i see it the root of all children's problems is unacceptable levels of imagination fun creativity and unbridled enthusiasm! don't you eyeball me! our goal at this school is to crush the dangerous elements inside you and replace them with structure order discipline and conformity.,season_1,45,23,93
sergeant,what--? whatcha doin'?,season_1,45,24,95
phineas,oh a few simple modifications. we call it the ferris bed. it makes trading off fair simple and fun... ...as well as giving easy access to the top bunk. all at the push of a button. pretty cool huh?,season_1,45,24,96

morty williams,today on the morty williams show my kid is bad and i want to blame others! we'll go inside the nation's toughest reformatory school where free-thinking children undergo complete personality re-programming and have all the creativity and imagination sucked right out of them. they are forced to think inside the box.,season_1,45,27,129

martians,,season_1,47,38,136

linda,the same old routine every day. doesn't it ever get-- mm i don't know-- boring?,season_1,48,5,16
candace,...you know what? you're right. i guess it has gotten a little old. i just get so frustrated. i always come so close to busting phineas and ferb but it ends the same way every single time. i look and say there's a massive thing phineas and ferb built right in front of me but every time you look you always say...,season_1,48,5,17

phineas,but all our building permits are in order.,season_1,48,13,43
linda,i mean my permission.,season_1,48,13,44
phineas,this morning i asked you if we could modify our car to make it fly.,season_1,48,13,45
linda,i was talking about your toy car!! how could you possibly think i meant my station wagon?! you are in so much trouble young man!!!,season_1,48,13,46

linda,what?!!,season_1,48,13,48
candace,see mom? i told you...but you never listened.,season_1,48,13,49
linda,but i...,season_1,48,13,50
memory-candaces,mom phineas and ferb built a rollercoaster! phineas and ferb are one-hit wonders? phineas and ferb carved my face into mount rushmore. phineas and ferb are driving cattle. phineas and ferb built a giant tree house robot... are promoting a boxing match...built a beach in the backyard...built a time machine... built a ski resort! are directing a movie... built a haunted house... built a giant sundae maker... are getting the band back together... phineas and ferb are in my large intestine!,season_1,48,14,52
linda,oh candace. all the times i called you delusional and mocked you to my friends behind your back all those journals i've filled with an eye towards stand-up comedy...but you were telling the truth! i'm so sorry. you're the best daughter any mother could dream of having.,season_1,48,14,53
candace,finally you realize that!,season_1,48,14,54
lawrence,well what's all this yelling about? oh my word! that is impressive.,season_1,48,14,55
linda,did you know about this?,season_1,48,14,56
lawrence,well i -- i...i -- i uh...no.,season_1,48,14,57
candace,i know! take away their seats on the city council!,season_1,48,14,58

phineas,we rotate out with the board of selectmen.,season_1,48,14,60
lawrence,well some punishment may be in order but look there's no harm done really.,season_1,48,14,61
phineas,hey look ferb here's bolt number 473. i hope that wasn't important.,season_1,48,14,62
phineas,well at least the self-parking works.,season_1,48,15,64
candace,ee-ee-ee-ee!,season_1,48,16,66
linda,i'm sorry but this is really for your own good. we need you both to understand that what you've been doing is way too dangerous. i'd never be able to live with myself if you got hurt.,season_1,48,18,69
phineas,we were wearing helmets. ,season_1,48,18,70
sergeant,don't worry. your boys will be in good hands. as you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure the smile away reformatory offers a serene peaceful environment in which safety discipline and responsibility are encouraged. your boys will be whipped into shape in no time.,season_1,48,18,71
phineas,well i'll be honest ferb i didn't see this coming. baljeet? what are you doing here?,season_1,48,18,72
baljeet,well i got kicked out of summer school because my grades were too high. but then i heard about this place. sure they break you down and strip you of your identity but school is school.,season_1,48,18,73
lawrence,bye boys. see you at the end of summer!,season_1,48,18,74
candace,yes i actually busted phineas and ferb! i'm finally free!,season_1,48,19,76

baljeet,i was too excited to wait. i shaved last night. just call me bald-jeet. heh-heh. get it? bald-jeet?,season_1,48,23,92
sergeant,okay listen up maggots! you are here because your parents are worried about you. now the way i see it the root of all children's problems is unacceptable levels of imagination fun creativity and unbridled enthusiasm! don't you eyeball me! our goal at this school is to crush the dangerous elements inside you and replace them with structure order discipline and conformity.,season_1,48,23,93
sergeant,what--? whatcha doin'?,season_1,48,24,95
phineas,oh a few simple modifications. we call it the ferris bed. it makes trading off fair simple and fun... ...as well as giving easy access to the top bunk. all at the push of a button. pretty cool huh?,season_1,48,24,96
phineas,you know this is a very inefficient way to clean a bathroom.,season_1,48,25,98
sergeant,that's the idea! now make it shine!,season_1,48,25,99
sergeant,and no funky rhythms! ,season_1,48,25,101
phineas,i thought it had more of a free-form jazz vibe. huh. well you can't please everybody.,season_1,48,25,102
candace,oh! ow-ow!,season_1,48,26,104
stacy,what did you do?,season_1,48,26,105
candace,i tripped over ferb's old toolbox.,season_1,48,26,106
stacy,well do you wanna go horseback riding?,season_1,48,26,107
candace,what's your hurry? let's relax for a little while. you know with phineas and ferb gone i've had a blast doing things i wanted to do. but it's strange. i kind of miss the little guys. it's as if there was a whole other side to our relationship that i never noticed before.,season_1,48,26,108
candace,uh stace you're kind of bumming me out with the song there.,season_1,48,27,126
stacy,you know you finally have everything you ever wanted. call me when you get over it. ,season_1,48,27,127
candace,ok. maybe a little tv will take my mind off things. ,season_1,48,27,128
morty williams,today on the morty williams show my kid is bad and i want to blame others! we'll go inside the nation's toughest reformatory school where free-thinking children undergo complete personality re-programming and have all the creativity and imagination sucked right out of them. they are forced to think inside the box.,season_1,48,27,129
candace,wait a second. they didn't belong in a place like that. i know what i have to do.,season_1,48,27,130
jeremy,hey candace.,season_1,48,27,131
candace,jeremy? how did you get in here?,season_1,48,27,132
jeremy,there's a huge gaping hole in the side of your house.,season_1,48,27,133
candace,oh yeah well phineas and ferb would've usually fixed that by now.,season_1,48,27,134
jeremy,you wanna go horseback riding?,season_1,48,27,135
candace,would you stop already with the horses? jeremy! i know what i'm gonna do today! i'm gonna bust my brothers...,season_1,48,27,136
jeremy,didn't you already do that?,season_1,48,27,137

jeremy,cool. i always liked your brothers. i'm coming with you.,season_1,48,27,139
candace,you mean like a date?,season_1,48,27,140
jeremy,yeah. a weird sort of prison-break kind of date.,season_1,48,27,141
recorded female voice,age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible. good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy. creative acts are imitable and dangerous. using your imagination is morally wrong.,season_1,48,28,143
baljeet,the book was so much better.,season_1,48,28,144
linda,hmm. it's a letter from the board of selectmen. the city council is proposing a millage to cover the overage from last quarter and they need phineas and ferb's input.,season_1,48,28,145
lawrence,perhaps we were a bit hard on them.,season_1,48,28,146
linda,yeah they really did believe they had permission. i suppose it was all a big misunderstanding.,season_1,48,28,147
lawrence,well let's go get 'em shall we? we can take the flying car of the future...today.,season_1,48,28,148
linda,weren't you supposed to get that changed back to normal?,season_1,48,28,149
lawrence,yes yes but you must admit it's pretty cool!,season_1,48,28,150
linda,yeah it's pretty cool.,season_1,48,28,151
lawrence,hey where's the flying car of the future...today?,season_1,48,28,152
candace,agh! sorry. the flying car of the future...today is pulling a bit to the right.,season_1,48,29,154
jeremy,are you kidding? this is the best date ever.,season_1,48,29,155
candace,whoa-oa-oa!,season_1,48,29,156
jeremy,maybe we should walk the rest of the way.,season_1,48,30,158
phineas,hey ferb i know what we're gonna do today. ,season_1,48,35,189

candace,dad is this one of those cultural things again? because i'm not sure they'd even know what the heck you're talking about in england.,season_2,1,2,14
phineas,ooh! it's possible nosey has survived because lake nose is unusually rich in zinc a common metal used in everything from sunblock to pennies. cool.,season_2,1,3,16
candace,oh of course! nosey the vicious zinc-eating dinosaur. now it makes perfect sense! thank you crazy people i live with!,season_2,1,3,17

carl,krill is a small shrimp-like creature that plays an important role in the diet of the humpback whale.,season_2,10,11,26
major monogram,..krill.,season_2,10,11,27
phineas,you know ferb perry's egg is getting kind of cold.,season_2,10,13,30
phineas,we need the ultimate best-ever egg hatcher. ferb i know what else we're gonna do today.,season_2,10,14,32
candace,five feet for popcorn fine! five feet to change a channel? i don't think so!,season_2,10,15,34

candace,hey this little fella is kind of cute.,season_2,10,15,36
announcer,here's one that's found himself in the unforgiving position of being stuck on his back. watch as he instinctively turns to his stomach.,season_2,10,15,37
candace,whoa! cool!,season_2,10,15,38
announcer,but the sea turtles' struggles are just beginning. without the protection of their mother they face many predators. as you can see they make easy prey even though the safety of the ocean is a mere five feet away.,season_2,10,15,39
candace,,season_2,10,15,40

phineas,nothing says mother's love like a giant robotic platypus butt.,season_2,10,19,48
announcer,unbeknownst to the delicate infant turtle it's caught the eye of a sea hawk and he's looking for a meal.,season_2,10,20,50
announcer,sadly the sea hawk wins this battle. unlike humans sea turtles don't have a mother to protect them through these crucial moments of infancy.,season_2,10,22,53
candace,what's that?,season_2,10,23,55
phineas,hey candace perry laid an egg!,season_2,10,25,58
candace,what are you doing to this precious gift of life?,season_2,10,25,59
phineas,after perry left his egg unattended we decided it would be best if we watched over it for him. given the rudimentary needs of the average egg we calculated the heat transfer due to elemental exposure plus the positive developing life responses to familiar and expected sound and factored the obvious visual surroundings. the result was the plat-a-droid but since we were pressed for time we only built the platy-posterior.,season_2,10,25,60
candace,that's so wrong in so many ways i don't even know where to start! an egg is like a little baby. it needs a living breathing mother. it needs... hold on one second.,season_2,10,25,61
candace,okay let's do this thing for real!,season_2,10,26,63
doofenshmirtz,ah perry the platypus! you're just in time for my backstory. you see it all started a lifetime ago.,season_2,10,27,66
doofenshmirtz,i was young and in love with a beautiful girl. she taught me how to see the beauty of life and i taught her how to hold a petty grudge. she was very interested in whales for some reason. in retrospect it was probably more of an unhealthy obsession but to win her heart i created the whale translator-inator! i rented the best oceanographic vessel that i could afford and we headed out. but when i turned the translator-inator on...,season_2,10,28,68
whale,..what a loser that guy up there is! she should dump that pink chimp and go out with a real mammal like me.,season_2,10,29,70
doofenshmirtz,she left me for that trash-talking 35-ton pile of blubber. and broke my fragile 10-ounce utterly-too-human heart.,season_2,10,29,71
doofenshmirtz,unfortunately my translator-inator only worked in one direction. so i was not able to tell the whales what i thought of them. until today. watch this. see i taught myself whale song. i just told him he's fat and he has barnacle breath.,season_2,10,30,73
doofenshmirtz,come on come on who's diabolical?,season_2,10,31,75
candace,okay first things first. dismantle that thingamajig of... of weirdness. sometimes i swear i'm the only normal one in this family. like i said. weirdness. now let's get serious. see what i'm wearing here? serious. this egg's not gonna hatch itself. we need to build a nursery.,season_2,10,33,78
phineas,we have this cool blueprint for an incubator!,season_2,10,33,79
candace,too antiseptic. think warm and loving not cold and clinical! hugs and kisses not hard and mechanical!,season_2,10,33,80
candace,so how does it feel to have your platy-posterior handed to you on a plate son?,season_2,10,34,101
doofenshmirtz,,season_2,10,35,103
doofenshmirtz,wait wait perry the platypus. where are you... where are you going? wait! wait! my evil plan isn't evil enough for you to foil? is that it? really? i've just insulted the macaroni and cheese recipe of a whale! what part of that is not evil?,season_2,10,36,105
doofenshmirtz,perry the platypus you get back here and thwart me this instant!,season_2,10,37,107
phineas,there that just about does it. candace!,season_2,10,39,110
candace,hmm. not bad for a couple of boys.,season_2,10,39,111
phineas,you're pretty good at this candace.,season_2,10,39,112
candace,you bet i am. this is what real mothering looks like!,season_2,10,39,113
doofenshmirtz,stymie meee! foil meee! hey what about the fact that i held a petty grudge against an inferior mammal all these years huh?,season_2,10,41,116
doofenshmirtz,thwart me perry the platypus.,season_2,10,42,118
doofenshmirtz,aw come on!,season_2,10,43,120

linda,all right. i'll try not to take that as an insult. what is the rest of this?,season_2,10,52,139
phineas,candace has us build this to show us what motherhood is like.,season_2,10,52,140
linda,okay. candace you made them build all this?,season_2,10,52,141
candace,no. that's not fair!,season_2,10,52,142
linda,you know candace you're gonna have to clean all this up. mom suit. i swear. i'm not even gonna ask.,season_2,10,52,143
candace,how do you only manage to see this one? why only mine? wait! come back! this is so unfair! wait!,season_2,10,52,144
jeremy,hmm. well nice mom suit.,season_2,10,52,145
candace,see? he gets it.,season_2,10,52,146

buford,see? isn't this the coolest game ever? it's called jump and duck.,season_2,11,1,1
phineas,hey how'd you get your face in there?,season_2,11,1,2
buford,easy. i just use this camera see? ,season_2,11,1,3

buford,look!,season_2,11,2,7

phineas,so beyond jumping and ducking what's the actual objective of this game?,season_2,11,5,13
buford,it's called jump and duck. duh.,season_2,11,5,14
baljeet,i can see no educational value in this game.,season_2,11,5,15
buford,duck!,season_2,11,5,16
buford,consider yourself educated.,season_2,11,6,18
baljeet,i stand corrected.,season_2,11,6,19

doofenshmirtz,you see back in gimmelshtump in the depths of my childhood my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. my mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. unfortunately the baby turned out to be a boy and because we were out of material i was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year. drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates.,season_2,11,15,48
doofenshmirtz,now with my ball gown-inator i will be the manliest man in the tri-state area! you know by comparison. because everyone else will be wearing dress. after i shoot them with my ball gown-inator. am am i over explaining this? because i have this whole musical number prepared and... oh oh you're good. take five girls.,season_2,11,16,50

adyson,all right then! let's go see what phineas and ferb are doing!,season_2,28,8,24
ginger,why don't we ever go see what baljeet is doing?,season_2,28,8,25
milly,because we've done that before.,season_2,28,8,26
holly,yeah and that patch wasn't worth it.,season_2,28,8,27
isabella,hey where's pinky?,season_2,28,8,28
wanda acronym,hello agent pinky. professor poofenplotz has been making a barrage of inquiries about hairspray of all things. it's all very suspicious. suss it out and put the kibosh on it.,season_2,28,10,31
isabella,hey guys. whatcha doin'?,season_2,28,13,35
phineas,well to be perfectly honest i don't know what i'm doing. i don't know what i've been doing. always getting so wrapped up in these silly projects that i don't care about. it's you i care about isabella! can we be together forever and ever?,season_2,28,13,36

poofenplotz,yes. can you tell me where you've moved your stiff beauty hair spray?,season_2,28,18,55

poofenplotz,discontinued?,season_2,28,18,57
worker,discontinued.,season_2,28,18,58
poofenplotz,so what you're saying is stiff beauty's no longer going to be sold.,season_2,28,18,59
worker,right. that's what discontinued means.,season_2,28,18,60
poofenplotz,how about i discontinue you from this dimension!,season_2,28,18,61
worker,this so isn't worth minimum wage.,season_2,28,19,63
poofenplotz,the only supply of stiff beauty left in the world is at the old abandoned old abandoned amusement park. and i intend to use my me-mobile to get me there!,season_2,28,20,65
gretchen,according to this fireside girls book on dendrology the maracanut tree is indigenous to mountain valley micro-climates. so it looks like we're heading in the right direction.,season_2,28,24,70
isabella,hi. excuse me. um hello. earth to hippie. excu-u-u-u-u-u-use me-e-e-e-e-e-e.,season_2,28,26,73

fireside girls,oooh!,season_2,28,26,75
isabella,would you possibly know where the maracanut trees might be located?,season_2,28,26,76
the guru,indeed i do my formidable little flower. behold. ,season_2,28,26,77
isabella,oh no! what happened? where did they all go?,season_2,28,26,78
the guru,they were all chopped down so their sap could be used for... ...hair spray. such a shame.,season_2,28,26,79
isabella,so there aren't any left?,season_2,28,26,80
the guru,don't fret my pet. there happens to be one sole maracanut tree left in existence. it's at the old abandoned old abandoned amusement park over on the next hill.,season_2,28,26,81
isabella,did you just say the old abandoned old abandoned amusement park?,season_2,28,26,82
the guru,yes. the old abandoned old abandoned amusement park.,season_2,28,26,83
isabella,old abandoned twice?,season_2,28,26,84

gretchen,this must be it chief. i think you're right.,season_2,28,34,113
isabella,stickiness is the most underrated of all the -nesses and of all the stickinesses the sap of the maracanut tree is the sticky-messiest. this temple of sap attraction is a monument to the rare and beautiful maracanut tree the world's greatest stickerizer. looks like we've tracked our quarry to its lair girls! although if their biggest attraction was a sap-themed ride i understand why this place closed down. girls get your gear. we're climbin' up.,season_2,28,34,114
holly,probably not a good idea. the whole thing's structurally unsound.,season_2,28,34,115
adyson,look out!,season_2,28,35,117
adyson,the whole place will fall!,season_2,28,38,121
gretchen,and there's no way to get that tree!,season_2,28,38,122

doofenshmirtz,ah the quaint town of whiskershire. it's a great place to fly nilly-willy through manacled to a rocket skiff this time of year.,season_2,35,44,157
phineas,friends bullies irving we've reached our conclusion as to the purpose of the object that landed in our front yard. we believe that it is an anti-romance rocket created to scan for and then eliminate romantic elements from potentially amorous situations.,season_2,35,46,160
isabella baljeet and irving,ohhhhhh.,season_2,35,46,161

isabella,i wonder what would make someone want to build something to destroy romance in the first place.,season_2,35,57,192
ferb,well if you reverse-engineer the human heart you're bound to find love at its core.,season_2,35,57,193

isabella,ooh! i hope i will see a real life seahorse! and get my underwater equestrian patch!,season_2,36,1,9

linda,oh honey jeremy's smart enough to separate your sandcastle from his feelings about you!,season_2,36,9,119
jeremy,okay now last but not least we have the flynn-fletchers...,season_2,36,9,120
candace,well it's not perfect but... we had fun doing it so i give you our sandcastle.,season_2,36,10,122

candace,hehe. i know! let's go get that blue ribbon!,season_2,36,12,131

phineas,i...see...why...dogs...enjoy...this...sensation!!!!!,season_2,37,4,31
candace,delayed! what do you mean delayed?,season_2,37,5,33
linda,candace honey the snow storm has delayed your grandparents' plane. your father and i have to wait here at the airport until they arrived. it may be hours...,season_2,37,5,34
candace,but i need your help! stacy told me that marcos told her that jeremy told him that he got the perfect gift for me!,season_2,37,5,35
linda,oh no. how will you manage?,season_2,37,5,36
candace,mom think! if jeremy found the perfect gift for me then i have to find the perfect gift for him!,season_2,37,5,37
linda,i thought you already got a gift for jeremy.,season_2,37,5,38
candace,i did but i can't show up with an obvious stupid present that anyone could've gotten him. the perfect gift means that you totally get the other person in the most deep and paying-attention-y way. if his gift to me is perfect and my gift to him isn't he's gonna be so hurt and insulted and think i'm lame and thoughtless and he'll stop liking me! ,season_2,37,5,39
linda,oh candace honey i don't think... you poor thing. forgive me boys. what are your brothers up to?,season_2,37,5,40
candace,love you mom gotta run bye!,season_2,37,5,41
phineas,plow!,season_2,37,7,44

phineas,house!,season_2,37,9,48
phineas,we're coming in too fast!,season_2,37,10,50
candace,those two are sooooo busted! that's not like you two.,season_2,37,11,52
phineas,we've been working on a way to seize the day while also not having to get out of bed so early. i think we can cross that one off our to-do list.,season_2,37,11,53
candace,let me see that. what is this? number one was write letters to santa claus. what did you start this to-do list when you were three years old?!,season_2,37,11,54
phineas,we write letters to santa claus every year. don't you?,season_2,37,11,55
candace,wah-hahahaha! letters to santa?!? ahahahaha! that's for little kids! hahaha!,season_2,37,11,56
phineas,santa's not just for little kids candace.,season_2,37,11,57
candace,okay fine. let's assume there is a santa claus.,season_2,37,11,58
phineas,well of course there is. there's been a ton of reported sightings. oregon 1978. northern scotland 1954. the so-called santa cloth found in istanbul 1912.,season_2,37,11,59
phineas,santa's one of our biggest heroes. talk about making the most out of one day. imagine flying around the whole world delivering toys and gifts to everybody in one night. ferb and i have done some cool stuff in our time but that that's something else.,season_2,37,12,61
candace,again let's assume there is a santa claus. he's got it easy. the hard part is trying to figure out what to get people want when they don't write you a letter telling you exactly what they want most. and by people i mean jeremy and by you i mean me... and uh no the rest is pretty much literal.,season_2,37,12,62
phineas,well i'm sure jeremy would get exactly what he wanted. if he wrote his own letter to santa.,season_2,37,12,63
candace,bwahahaha letters to santa!? ,season_2,37,12,64
phineas,wow. she's lapped us.,season_2,37,12,65
candace,wait that's it! i'll trick jeremy into writing a letter to santa so i can sneak a peek and learn what he wants straight from the horse's mouth. and by mouth i mean pen and by horse i mean jeremy and... yeah we're good.,season_2,37,12,66
phineas,or you could ask him directly what he wants to avoid any unnecessary complications.,season_2,37,12,67
candace,you are such a child sometimes. ,season_2,37,13,69
phineas,you know ferb just think of all the wonderful things santa does for us and he never asks for anything in return. wait that's it! ferb are you thinking what i'm thinking?,season_2,37,13,70
phineas,as usual we're...oh! ugh! man no that's not at all what i was thinking! oh! dude!,season_2,37,14,72
phineas,oh. yeah. that's it. i'll call in the troops you wonder where perry is.,season_2,37,15,74
snowman,hello! wintertime's fun! follow me! come on! follow me! ...plow!!!,season_2,37,17,78
major monogram,ah agent p. there you are. merry christmas. oh great you brought snacks.,season_2,37,19,81

carl,oh a sal tuscany christmas. you lucked out agent p. your secret santa has exquisite taste.,season_2,37,21,86
major monogram,criminy carl. it's supposed to be a secret santa.,season_2,37,21,87
carl,what? no! i didn't get it for him.,season_2,37,21,88
major monogram,huh right. ,season_2,37,21,89
carl,no really i didn't!,season_2,37,21,90
major monogram,the more you protest the more we know you gave it to him.,season_2,37,21,91
carl,fine! think what you want! whatever! ,season_2,37,21,92
major monogram,okay scrooge. we got it.,season_2,37,21,93
major monogram,uh-oh sorry agent p. i guess evil never takes a holiday. if you'll direct your attention to the screen. good morning agent p. a wise man once said... eyes on the screen.,season_2,37,22,95
major monogram,a wise man once said evil never takes a holiday. we don't know what doofenshmirtz is up to. but he's evil and evil people hate christmas. it's a cliche sad cliche. good luck agent p and merry christmas.,season_2,37,23,97
major monogram,carl! stop filming your butt film mine. it's a party!,season_2,37,24,99
jeremy,hello?,season_2,37,25,101
candace,happy christmas eve my little drummer boy.,season_2,37,25,102
jeremy,hey candace. you know i don't play drums. i play guitar.,season_2,37,25,103
candace,i know silly-billy. so whatcha doin?,season_2,37,25,104
jeremy,not sleeping anymore. how 'bout you?,season_2,37,26,106
candace,i just thought it was the perfect day to show some christmas spirit. like when you were young and wrote letters to santa... i'm sorry what was i saying?,season_2,37,26,107
jeremy,...writing letters to santa claus?,season_2,37,26,108
candace,bwahahaha letters to santa!? oh! brilliant idea. let's get together and write letters to santa and be very specific within a reasonable price range. for fun. i'll be over in a bit.,season_2,37,26,109
jeremy,candace this isn't one of these thing...,season_2,37,26,110
candace,hehehe he doesn't suspect a thing. 'cause i don't have a clue.,season_2,37,27,112
phineas,awesome! phase one complete. hey guys.,season_2,37,30,141
buford,cool clubhouse.,season_2,37,31,143
phineas,oh no. this is not how you would say a clubhouse. this is the ultimate rest and relaxation lounge perfectly tailored to the jolly rubenesque world traveler. it's a rest stop for santa.,season_2,37,31,144
isabella,oh i see.,season_2,37,31,145
baljeet,oh why did you not just say that?,season_2,37,31,146
phineas,highlights include: sauna massage table satellite television elliptical machine to work off all the milk and cookies milk and cookies reindeer feeding station and of course beard purifier. but this is only the beginning. remember when you wrote letters to santa asking him for presents?,season_2,37,31,147
isabella/buford/baljeet,yes.,season_2,37,31,148
candace,bwah ha ha ha ha! letters to santa!?! ah ha ha!!,season_2,37,31,149
phineas,did you always get the presents you asked for?,season_2,37,31,150
isabella/buford/baljeet,pretty much yes!,season_2,37,31,151
phineas,of course. now did you ever write a thank-you note to santa?,season_2,37,31,152
isabella/buford/baljeet,well no but...nobody ever told... no.,season_2,37,31,153
phineas,well i think it's time someone did something cool for santa to show him we appreciate everything he does for us. so we're gonna turn the entire city of danville into a giant shimmering thank-you card for santa claus.,season_2,37,31,154
buford,so what you're saying is it's not a clubhouse.,season_2,37,31,155
doofenshmirtz,oh what the heck. kickline!,season_2,37,34,188
doofenshmirtz,i have an intense burning indifference!,season_2,37,34,191
doofenshmirtz,i didn't even create the naughty-inator myself because i compulsively obsessively just couldn't be bothered. nah the plans were mailed to me from borneo where my uncle justin is rumored to be in hiding. it's really a sweet gift but how can i destroy christmas without having a good reason? but to sit and wait for a reason.,season_2,37,34,192
phineas,alright everyone i want to thank you all for helping. grab yourself some decorations and let's get our grateful on.,season_2,37,36,196
jeremy,hey in a minute candace. i'm right in the middle of something here. i was thinking you could maybe help me finish decorating. first.,season_2,37,37,216
candace,no! it'll be too late! the stores will all be closed! and by stores i mean the post office and by buying a gift i mean mailing the letters.,season_2,37,37,217
jeremy,you didn't say buying a gift.,season_2,37,37,218
candace,oh good. that would have been a dead giveaway.,season_2,37,37,219
phineas,hey everyone! the next decoration delivery is here!,season_2,37,37,220
jeremy,the tinsel!,season_2,37,37,221
candace,w-wait come back! our letters! we have to write them quickly! i already licked the stamps!,season_2,37,37,222
doofenshmirtz,you know all i really want for christmas is the ability to hate christmas. is that too much to ask? hmm were you expecting anyone?,season_2,37,39,225
doofenshmirtz,ah yes. how can you hate christmas listening to that?,season_2,37,39,230
doofenshmirtz,bring us figgy pudding. well you can say please. but you know whatever great. figgy pudding.,season_2,37,39,233
doofenshmirtz,whoa! what! are you threatening me?,season_2,37,39,238
doofenshmirtz,how dare you! no one barges into my home and demand desserts. what sort of plan is that anyway? let's go to a stranger's house and insult him in song form and refuse to leave until he hands over a fruit dish that no one's prepared since the 16th century. well if that's how things are i have my reasons to push this button. so long christmas you're feliz navi-dead to me! see? uh it was spanish.,season_2,37,39,240
doofenshmirtz,'tis the season to be naughty!,season_2,37,40,242
old caroler,can i at least get a diet soda?,season_2,37,40,243
blay'n,what do we have here? oh! tsk! tsk!,season_2,37,42,246
clewn't,oh blay'n. oop! what do you have there?,season_2,37,42,247
blay'n,oh just a bunch of last minute naughties. it's a shame huh clewn't?,season_2,37,42,248
clewn't,kids! they get worse every year. ungrateful little... i'll go sit in the dark and mutter to myself.,season_2,37,42,249
burdensome elf,he wasn't always that way. in fact he used to love kids. in fact he used to be where the action is. toy making. in fact he was the fastest best toymaker of them all. in fact they used to call him clewn't the fastest best toymaker of them all. though they just called him clewn't for short which also happens to be his name so the nickname thing was a kind of a moot point. in fact... just go up and talk to the first person you see. that's how you make friends. i'm never going to another seminar.,season_2,37,42,250
candace,okay listen you twerps. your ridiculous efforts to thank santa claus are getting in the way of my ridiculous efforts to get jeremy into writing a letter to santa claus. so why don't you... hey what's with the clouds?,season_2,37,43,252
phineas,whoa! is it me or does the sky look really dark and ominous as if its foreshadowing events which will have a negative impact on our lives.,season_2,37,44,254
mailman,i'm sorry kids looks like everyone in danville got a return on their letters to santa. they've all been stamped naughty.,season_2,37,45,256
phineas,what?,season_2,37,45,257
jeremy,hey candace look! i did it. i wrote a letter to santa saying in great detail what gift i want most.,season_2,37,45,258
candace,cool! thank you my little town of bethlehem. i'll just hang onto that for you.,season_2,37,45,259
mailman,oh i'll take that buddy. maybe you'll have better luck with santa than your friends.,season_2,37,45,260
candace,but but... uhh!,season_2,37,45,261
phineas,santa thinks everybody in danville's been naughty.,season_2,37,45,262
buford,now that's just nonsense.,season_2,37,46,264
phineas,but but how can that be.,season_2,37,47,266
candace,oh well let's see. what's different this year than last year? oh i know! you went out and got everyone in danville involved in one of your off-the-cuff harebrained schemes.,season_2,37,47,267
phineas,you think this could be my fault?,season_2,37,47,268
candace,oh who can say really? but sometimes we do naughty things without having any idea they're naughty. sometimes we do an entire summer's worth of them. ,season_2,37,47,269
phineas,could this be true?,season_2,37,47,270
isabella/buford/baljeet,oh no...i mean how could...well i guess it...,season_2,37,47,271
isabella/buford,maybe.,season_2,37,47,272
baljeet,i am cold.,season_2,37,47,273
anchorman,this is gordon gutsofanemu reporting from the googolplex mall here in downtown danville. the christmas all but banished ever since santa claus stamped big red naughty across this once nice city.,season_2,37,50,278
phineas,it was all a bad dream! christmas wasn't cancelled!,season_2,37,51,280
isabella,phineas! no matter how many times you try that it's not going to work.,season_2,37,51,281
phineas,maybe if i hadn't gotten out of bed today i wouldn't have done the things santa thought was naughty.,season_2,37,51,282
isabella,so what? are you going to stay here for the rest of your life?,season_2,37,51,283
phineas,why not?,season_2,37,51,284
isabella,well for one the mall closes in twenty minutes.,season_2,37,52,286
buford,i don't see what everyone's so worried about. i got this system see? you act any way you want all year long but then right before christmas you do one big act selfless act of kindness and santa will wipe your slate clean. works like a charm.,season_2,37,52,287
baljeet,really? so i might still have my one big christmas wish come true?,season_2,37,52,288
buford,maybe.,season_2,37,52,289
baljeet,are you not going ask me what my christmas wish is?,season_2,37,52,290
buford,nope. it'll only wanna make me hurt you which will counteract my one act of kindness.,season_2,37,52,291
baljeet,all i want is one sweet special christmas kiss under the mistletoe.,season_2,37,52,292
buford,i'm outta here.,season_2,37,52,293
baljeet,not from you! from a pretty girl! do not flatter yourself!,season_2,37,52,294
doofenshmirtz,ugh! don't you see what's going on out there? game over! your plan failed! there's no figgy pudding! there's no christmas! you can all just go home!,season_2,37,55,300
doofenshmirtz,ugh!,season_2,37,55,303
josh,come on guys let's do but it's christmas becky.,season_2,37,55,304
becky,you got to get over me josh!,season_2,37,55,305
jeremy,okay bye. i gotta get home. suzy's pretty upset that about santa not coming.,season_2,37,57,308
candace,but wait no! let's do some last minute window shopping.,season_2,37,57,309
jeremy,candace tell me what's wrong. i can't read your mind.,season_2,37,57,310
candace,yes you can. that's the problem.,season_2,37,57,311
jeremy,i don't understand. what is it you want from me?,season_2,37,57,312
candace,oh right! like you need me to tell you that. the question is what do you want from me?,season_2,37,57,313
jeremy,i just want you to tell me what you want.,season_2,37,57,314
candace,fine! i just want you to tell me what you want.,season_2,37,57,315
jeremy,i don't want anything.,season_2,37,57,316
candace,nothing? right yours is perfect and i show up with nothing. do want me to look like a total monster!,season_2,37,57,317
jeremy,candace that doesn't even make any sense.,season_2,37,57,318
candace,it's just that i think you're perfect jeremy. so i don't understand why you want to make me to feel like i'm not.,season_2,37,57,319
jeremy,candace you should know me better than that. look i have to go home.,season_2,37,57,320
candace,oh how did this go so wrong?,season_2,37,57,321
phineas,all except for buford 'cause he's got that whole last minute reprieve theory.,season_2,37,58,329
buford,it's gonna work. you watch.,season_2,37,58,330
phineas,no! y-you know what? i ca-can't except this. i know danville and danville is not naughty. we need to send a message to the north pole to let them know there's been some sort of mistake.,season_2,37,58,336
isabella,but how do we do that?,season_2,37,58,337
baljeet,yes they're not evening answer our mail.,season_2,37,58,338
phineas,wait! i've got an idea. ferb i know what else we're gonna do today.,season_2,37,59,340
man,the north pole? well i hate to tell you this phineas but wjop only reaches the greater danville area. we just don't have a very powerful transmitter.,season_2,37,60,342
phineas,you leave that to us.,season_2,37,60,343
blay'n,danville. what's he talking about?,season_2,37,62,357
clewn't,let me see that list of last minute naughties.,season_2,37,62,358
blay'n,they're all from the same place.,season_2,37,62,359
clewn't,hmmm. we've got to get to the bottom of this....,season_2,37,62,360
everyone,,season_2,37,62,361
doofenshmirtz,uh uh guys. don't hate me but i went into the kitchen to get some almond brittle...love it!...and lo and behold it turns out i did have some figgy pudding. quite a bit actually. i i guess this whole thing was pretty easily resolved. i feel kinda sheepish for making a big deal. anyway here figgy pudding.,season_2,37,64,369
josh,come on guys. our work here is done.,season_2,37,64,370
doofenshmirtz,bye bye now. thank you for the evil motivation for destroying christmas!,season_2,37,64,371
phineas,well that was fun at least.,season_2,37,66,374
isabella,what do you think the chances are that anyone in the north pole saw that?,season_2,37,66,375
blay'n,hello! hello! hello!,season_2,37,66,376
phineas,i'd say pretty good.,season_2,37,66,377
clewn't,so what's all this business about danville then?,season_2,37,66,378
doofenshmirtz,what's this? a sal tuscany christmas... score! what a perfect way to enjoy the last several hours before christmas officially doesn't come.,season_2,37,68,381
doofenshmirtz,alright! you know this one's really grown on me.,season_2,37,68,384
phineas,so that's what happened. do you think it could be a mistake?,season_2,37,70,388
clewn't,a whole city deemed naughty at once.,season_2,37,70,389
blay'n,i've never seen anything like it.,season_2,37,70,390
candace,huh?,season_2,37,71,392
phineas,oh hey candace. these are two of santa's elves.,season_2,37,71,393
candace,you gotta be kidding me.,season_2,37,71,394
phineas,blay'n clewn't this is my sister.,season_2,37,71,395
clewn't,ah yes candace flynn.,season_2,37,71,396
candace,you know who i am?,season_2,37,71,397
clewn't,no that's not a good thing.,season_2,37,71,398
isabella,they're here trying to figure out why danville was branded naughty.,season_2,37,71,399
candace,well maybe everyone did something naughty.,season_2,37,71,400
clewn't,no it doesn't work that way. you see everyone does naughty things from time to time but that's different from being a naughty person.,season_2,37,71,401
blay'n,you see santa's very forgiving.,season_2,37,71,402
clewn't,oh jolly to a fault if you ask me.,season_2,37,71,403
blay'n,well something is definitely screwy around here. according to these readings as if the city itself is misbehaving.,season_2,37,71,404
voice,uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh. ,season_2,37,73,407
major monogram,uh-oh agent p. it turns out carl was lying about getting you that sal tuscany cd.,season_2,37,73,408
carl,i never said i got it for him.,season_2,37,73,409
major monogram,quiet carl! haven't you caused enough harm? your so-called secret santa must've somehow infiltrated the agency and uh until we get to the bottom of it whatever you do do not play that cd.,season_2,37,73,410
doofenshmirtz,boy this sal tuscany guy is good. let me crank it up some more.,season_2,37,73,411
doofenshmirtz,what the? how did he...?,season_2,37,75,417
doofenshmirtz,okay so we'll have christmas. i simply don't care. curse my intensely burning apathy towards chri-,season_2,37,76,419
baljeet,oh it is hopeless. i am never going to get my special mistletoe christmas kiss. ah!,season_2,37,79,423
buford,and i'm never going to get my one great act of kindness.,season_2,37,79,424
baljeet,those were long johns.,season_2,37,79,425
phineas,what about you isabella? isn't there some big christmas wish that your afraid won't come true?,season_2,37,79,426

phineas,yes i knew your heart will lead you to the truth.,season_2,37,79,430

blay'n,yeah! nice! nice! everywhere! everyone nice. except for him. sorry.,season_2,37,79,432
phineas,well that's great. all you have to do is tell santa and christmas is back on right?,season_2,37,79,433
blay'n,uh mmm. it's not that simple. you see santa's already left. the elves loaded the sleigh and map out his route; it's too late now. santa's not coming to danville.,season_2,37,79,434
blay'n,it's too late now. santa's not coming to danville.,season_2,37,82,439
phineas,well that doesn't seem fair.,season_2,37,82,440
clewn't,what are you gonna do about?,season_2,37,82,441

doofenshmirtz,oh don't bother trying to escape. the walls are made of a super-slick alloy and treated with a few dozen coats of non-stick cooking spray. i'm sure you've noticed my impressive collection of aerosol spray cans. every can of aerosol deodorant hair spray and bug repellent from the tri-state area. all mine. i'm tapping into their ozone-depleting propellants to fuel my latest evil scheme: the aerosol-propelled ozone-deplete-inator! the citizens of danville will definitely learn the name of heinz doofenshmirtz when i spell it out in the sky in hundred-foot-tall letters made of atmosphere-destroying aerosol gasses thereby depleting the protective ozone layer. and the resulting radiation will burn my name right through town! then they'll remember. and if they don't they can just look outside. i need a little drink of water after a tirade like that.,season_2,45,6,53

doofenshmirtz,perry the platypus!?!,season_2,53,70,247
doofenshmirtz,just because we're stranded on a deserted island doesn't mean we should abandon our normal lives don't you think? because then the tiki gods would win! so i made myself supreme ruler of the tri-coconut area when no one was looking. it stretches all the way from the big rock over there where i'm drying my socks and undies to those three coconut trees at the end of the beach. and i have my minions. look if they don't obey i eat them. what's that look?,season_2,53,70,249

phineas,yes yes we did.,season_2,54,7,31
linda,good for you. i would've been home sooner but it took me an hour to drive around the road construction in the neighborhood. it sure would be helpful if they could just make the days a little longer. who do i call about that?,season_2,54,7,32
phineas,hey do you mind? we have a visual gag going on here. our vacation is more than halfway over and what have we accomplished? okay so we built a rollercoaster we traveled through time twice found atlantis blah blah blah blah blah blah blah see? we've hardly done anything! we need a real challenge. we need to create the biggest longest funnest summer day of all time!,season_2,54,8,34
dr. doofenshmirtz,well vanessa are you looking forward to seeing tokyo on our daddy-daughter trip?,season_2,54,9,38
vanessa,yeah... i was really hoping for paris. i mean i did drop all those hints but i guess tokyo is more exotic.,season_2,54,9,39
dr. doofenshmirtz,yes that's why i chose japan over paris at the last moment! that makes perfect sense. there is no other ulterior motive behind it all so you know...,season_2,54,9,40
airplane captain,uh this is your captain speaking we're expecting a slight delay for our arrival to tokyo.,season_2,54,9,41

candace,so if phineas and ferb are up to something bust-worthy and i am as you say... in charge i have free reign to call you as many times as necessary?,season_2,54,10,49
lawrence,quite the contrary candace. being in charge means you handle things yourself.,season_2,54,10,50
linda,yup. basically if you're really in charge you won't need to call at all. you see if the boys are doing something bust-worthy that means you're not doing your job and you would be in trouble too.,season_2,54,10,51
candace,woah woah heavy! by busting the boys i bust myself?,season_2,54,10,52

buford,it's a name followed by a big number!,season_2,54,14,69
phineas,it's fast and it runs on vegetable oil so it's environmentally friendly. in this ship we will travel around the world as the sun does making this the longest day of summer even longer! that'll give us twenty-four hours of continuous daylight; and add the extra fifteen hours we would've had anyway that's almost a forty-hour day!,season_2,54,14,70
buford,it can't be done! there's only twenty-four hours in a day and that's that!,season_2,54,14,71
phineas,well yes and no. you see buford if you define the day by the passage of the sun and we follow the sun by traveling around the...,season_2,54,14,72
buford,nah nah! don't try to confuse me with your sorcerous ways. there's nothin' i've ever seen that would make me believe you could pull this off. except for that time-machine thing and oh and the rollercoaster! but other than that nothin'! oh and the time you played that song when the platypus came back oh... man nature just bends to your will doesn't it?,season_2,54,14,73
phineas,yeah nothing's impossible if you believe you could do it.,season_2,54,14,74
buford,well i don't believe and therefore it's impossible. and what's more i bet you can't do it!,season_2,54,14,75
phineas,you bet us?,season_2,54,14,76
buford,yeah i bet you! and if you lose you're gonna have to stand up in front of everyone and say that you are governed by the laws of physics and summer's not whatever you want to make of it. and what's more you've gonna spend the rest of your summer doin' nothin'!,season_2,54,14,77
phineas,and what happens when we win?,season_2,54,14,78

candace,why would you build an elevator that doesn't go down?,season_2,57,15,52
phineas,because people might just ride down on the elevator instead of going through the maze.,season_2,57,15,53
candace,what do you mean maze...?,season_2,57,15,54
phineas,we had the computer randomly load puzzles and brain teasers to make clearing each level more of a challenge. okay first one out is the smartest rat in the lab.,season_2,57,16,56

buford,less talk-y more work-y.,season_2,57,18,70
doofenshmirtz,ahh perry the platypus welcome to my evil space station! wait did you hear that? that cookie part? i think my echo is broken i really do. any who...have a seat. i've set up a presentation for you. ten years ago i was backpacking across europe when i came across a group of canadian college student. dylan was the most popular among the group but but i was the oldest so rivalry was inevitable.,season_2,57,21,95
buford,how many jellybeans in the jar?,season_2,57,22,97
baljeet,oh i'm really good on solving these kind of problems.,season_2,57,22,98
phineas,so the base of the jar is pi times radius squared.,season_2,57,23,100
baljeet,you are measuring the radius in centimeters right?,season_2,57,23,101
phineas,no inches. that way the inches fractions work with pi as 22 over 7.,season_2,57,23,102
baljeet,you do not use 3.14 for pi?,season_2,57,23,103
buford,oh for crying out loud!,season_2,57,23,104
buford,there zero.,season_2,57,24,106
baljeet,okay technically that is correct but you did not show your work.,season_2,57,25,108
buford,i will in about 20 minutes.,season_2,57,25,109
dr. doofenshmirtz,...then the ambassador's wife filed a complaint... long story short i am never welcome in albania ever again. but the point is i ended up alone in italy and it was lunch time so i went to the leaning tower of pizza and you know what? they don't even make pizza there! and i said what do they mean? it's the leaning tower of pizza! it's got pizza actually in the name! but they were adamant. no pizza for me! l-l-likelike i'm the idiot. i was like you're not so great. you're not so special. what? just 'cause you're leaning? then it hit me. i'll just lean my own building and then it will become a big tourist attraction and i'll sell all this merchandise i'll make millions. which i will then use to finance phase two of my maniacal plan: tilting every building in the world! and the leaning tower of pizza will no long be special. ooh ooh and then i'll straighten my own building and it will still be a tourist attract 'cause you know it's the only straight building. i just now thought of that. just now. see that's how genius happens. it's a lot of leaning and straightening you get the idea. i'm going to use this tilt-inator and do it all from space! there! there it was again. you -- you heard that? my next to last echo is broken. i'm going to have to have that checked.,season_2,57,26,111
isabella,wow it's some kind of high wire challenge good thing i got my high wire patch twice.,season_2,57,27,113

isabella,glad i was able help.,season_2,57,30,125
doofenshmirtz,the tilt-inator is set with an automatic timer once it's activated even i can't stop it. all that's left to do is open the bay doors this may take awhile.,season_2,57,31,127
melissa,how far down is it?,season_2,57,32,129
isabella,i don't know i can't see the bottom. but it almost doesn't matter so long as we get across it.,season_2,57,32,130
candace,of course we need to know how deep it is so we know how scared we should be. we can use this grappling hook and rope to find out. you see? now we know that it's three seconds deep.,season_2,57,32,131
doofenshmirtz,...and done. so perry the platypus in fifteen seconds will turn my building into the leaning tower of doofenshmirtz! and you'll notice there's no self-destruct button no reverse levers no abort switches it's completely perry the platy-proof! nothing can stop me now!,season_2,57,33,133
doofenshmirtz,uh oh. no no no no no! stop stop stop stop stop! stop it!,season_2,57,34,135

isabella,okay... now that we want to get across it sure would be nice to have a grappling hook and some rope.,season_2,57,36,140

candace,standing around dorking it up boring. there's just too much for one person to do. if only there were two of me one to bust my brothers and one to be with jeremy.,season_2,61,2,3
buford,look what baljeet did to my candy bar. he got peanut butter on my chocolate. look at this mess! look at it! ,season_2,61,3,5

buford,i don't wanna taste two things at one time! it's unnatural.,season_2,61,3,7
phineas,well you're in luck. we just finished our molecular separator. it's our cool new machine that breaks things down into their components parts. we used it to separate a mule into a horse and a donkey. and to separate shampoo plus conditioner into shampoo and conditioner. ferb?,season_2,61,3,8
buford,witchcraft!,season_2,61,4,10

doofenshmirtz,perry the platypus i'm glad you're here. i'm just in line for the high dive. you see it reminds me of the high dive i knew as a kid at the gimmelshtump public wetness maker.,season_2,61,13,28
doofenshmirtz,it wasn't so much of a pool as it was just a...we'll just say that it only had water in it on alternating thursdays and leave it at that.,season_2,61,14,30
heinz's father,are you a man or a schnitzel?,season_2,61,14,32
young heinz,i'm a man i'm a man.,season_2,61,14,33

doofenshmirtz,after that my father and i became increasingly distant.,season_2,61,17,40
heinz's father,zu nah! ,season_2,61,17,41
doofenshmirtz,now i will conquer my fear and jump from the high dive. but you know i still don't want any of these people to look at me and make fun of me. so i invented the look-away-inator! you'd think it would attract a lot of attention at a public pool but so far no one's noticed it. it must be leaking or something.,season_2,61,18,43
doofenshmirtz,anyway when i do my man making dive you can bet that no one in the tri-state area will be looking. sure it may be tough for people who happen to be driving plus brain surgeons might have a problem too. but it's really a small price to pay for me becoming a man right?,season_2,61,19,45
doofenshmirtz,you're right. i gotta trap you.,season_2,61,20,47

doofenshmirtz,back in gimmelshtump one day when i was walking through the claw machine district something caught my eye. in this machine that usually just has rocks in it there was an actual teddy bear! fortunately i had with me my allowance which i'd been saving for a whole year: one three-cent coin. i dropped it into a slot then carefully maneuvered the claw toward the beckoning fuzzy grail! odds were against me but then it happened! the miracle! the claw grabbed the stuffed animal; it was mine! then like a knight of yore i gallantly gave the prize to my beloved mother... who immediately turned around and gave it to my brother roger. i was crushed as i watched roger produce a big red marker and write his name on the toy. and then afterwards proceed to do the same to my mother claiming both as his own effectively shutting me out of the family dynamic.,season_2,63,28,89

doofenshmirtz,it's greased! so now that you're all comfy cozy i can introduce you to my rain-inator! i've been using it to pour millions of gallons of water into these clouds causing it to rain all over the tri-state area! i can't believe nobody's noticed it. it's kind of obvious.,season_3,1,19,54
isabella,yay! we made it across the desert! say phineas i don't suppose you could help us out with our rainforest navigation patch?,season_3,1,20,56

candace,coming!!!,season_3,1,28,81
doofenshmirtz,so i bet you're wondering why did i cause all this rain. you see while perusing local garage sales i came upon a big screen tv from 1985. but when i went to turn it on it was stuck on the spanish channel!,season_3,1,29,83
doofenshmirtz,all it played was crazy variety shows and mexican soap operas. it has three simultaneous story lines that interconnect... genius! anyway the last episode was a cliffhanger...,season_3,1,30,85
doofenshmirtz,...in which esmerelda is going to find out why juan loves her. at least i think that's what's going to happen... but the show got preempted by a soccer game! oh i hate soccer! it makes no sense whatsoever! the clock runs up instead of counting down what is that?! so with the help of my rain-inator i rained the game out.,season_3,1,31,87

doofenshmirtz,it started two days ago when i was watering my plants. i noticed a beautiful garden on my neighbor's balcony. oooh i got so jealous. so the guy at the store told me—among other things—that my plants wouldn't grow because i didn't have a green thumb. a-and i should stop bothering with these types of plant questions and that my mere presence in the store was destroying his plants. so i got a big bucket of green paint and i poured it on myself. then i was green everywhere except strangely my thumbs i think it was the way i was holding the bucket.,season_3,7,15,61
doofenshmirtz,anyhoo with another great idea i created the moisture suck-inator! see? see? i don't know why i built it here when i was going to use it on the balcony... that wasn't-- anyhoo this device will suck all the moisture out of my neighbor's plants which will turn them brown and make my plants look greener by comparison. and i will finally have a green thumb! you know not actually—metaphorically! i’ll have a gre--,season_3,7,16,63

driver,and they laughed at me for installing a platypult tow rig. who's laughing now wayne?,season_3,18,130,475
candace,the logical explanation is the mysterious force the question is why does it care so much about my little brothers? why doesn't it want them to get busted?,season_3,18,131,477
buford,well why don't you ask it kierkegaard? came with the gum.,season_3,18,131,478

major monogram,kids i'm sorry but now that agent p's cover has been blown you won't be allowed to see him anymore.,season_3,18,355,1273
phineas,that's why you didn't want us to know your secret. so we'll never see perry again? there has to be another way!,season_3,18,355,1274
major monogram,sorry phineas. it isn't safe you know too much.,season_3,18,355,1275
phineas,now i never wished so much that i could un-know something.,season_3,18,355,1276
carl,sir maybe there is a way. what about dr. doofenshmirtz's amnesia-nator?,season_3,18,355,1277
doofenshmirtz,i never built an amnesia-nator. i think i'd remember building something like that.,season_3,18,355,1278
major monogram,well that might work but you'd all have to agree.,season_3,18,355,1279
phineas,so our choice is to: either forget the best day ever forget the greatest adventure we've ever had and forget meeting agent p or remember today but never see perry again?,season_3,18,355,1280
ferb,well we've had a lot of great days but we only have one perry.,season_3,18,356,1282

baljeet,no thank you. i am not a big fan of bicycle racing.,season_3,19,1,2
phineas,ah come on. everyone loves a good bike race.,season_3,19,1,3
baljeet,not me. you see i come from a long line of bicycle race losers.,season_3,19,1,4
baljeet,in 1903 my great-grandfather was leading a bicycle race but he fell into a tiger pit. years later my grandfather skillfully avoided the tiger pit but sadly not the tiger. then my father was confident he had outsmarted the tiger but he was wrong.,season_3,19,3,7
baljeet,my point is none of them finished in the top ten.,season_3,19,4,9
phineas,you know tiger attacks are comparatively rare in danville since we installed that tiger excluder on city hall.,season_3,19,4,10
phineas,ferb i know what baljeet is gonna do today!,season_3,19,5,12
linda,hey candace. i was just heading out to margie's baby shower and look what i found on the stoop.,season_3,19,7,15

baljeet,wait; underwater?,season_3,19,12,27
phineas,we tricked the bikes out a little. just push the button on your handle bars when you encounter any unusual terrain.,season_3,19,12,28
baljeet,what about tiger attacks?,season_3,19,12,29
phineas,technically that's not a terrain. isabella was kind enough to enlist the help of the fireside girls to make the course guide us and help out along the way.,season_3,19,12,30
buford,more racey less talky. sweet!,season_3,19,12,31
isabella,race ya to the front-line!,season_3,19,12,32
phineas,you're on!,season_3,19,12,33
baljeet,well it does seem to indicate a pattern.,season_3,19,12,35
phineas,just remember you have something that they didn't have. greg lemond! ,season_3,19,12,36

baljeet,so like recently?,season_3,19,12,38
greg lemond,that's not the point. the point is i see a kid who needs inspiration.,season_3,19,12,39
baljeet,oh you mean me right?,season_3,19,12,40
greg lemond,that's right baljeet. don't let anything stop you. there's nothing in this world that you can't do.,season_3,19,12,41
baljeet,actually i can think of many things i can not do. flying comes to mind. also putting my foot behind my head but it occurs to me that you're speaking hyperbolically. so point taken greg lemond! i'm going to win this race!,season_3,19,12,42
greg lemond,that's the spirit! u-s-a! u-s-a!,season_3,19,12,43

doofenshmirtz,really got to watch my step around here. but as you see you're trapped... in a pile of old computer cables.,season_3,19,20,64
doofenshmirtz,i've started throwing them in a drawer years ago and i'm... i'm sure there's probably one wire you can pull like a... i'd figured it would be easier to use it as a trap so i did. see? recycling.,season_3,19,21,66
buford,uh oh! big round wet thing comin' up!,season_3,19,24,70
phineas,press your buttons everybody!,season_3,19,24,71

phineas,don't give up baljeet!,season_3,19,25,75
baljeet,never!,season_3,19,25,76
greg lemond,baljeet you're not quitting are you?,season_3,19,25,77
baljeet,no sir mr. lemond. i came to win!,season_3,19,25,78
greg lemond,i know things are tough. there's a little voice telling you to quit.,season_3,19,25,79
baljeet,i hear no voice.,season_3,19,25,80
greg lemond,but you can quit.,season_3,19,25,81
baljeet,but i do not want to quit!,season_3,19,25,82
greg lemond,hey; true story. hunting accident. my brother-in-law thought i was a turkey. kaboom! but i recovered and you can too.,season_3,19,25,83
baljeet,wow; i have no idea how to respond that. i think i will be continuing on with the race now.,season_3,19,25,84
greg lemond,dropping out seems like an easy way but years from now i don't want you to look back and wonder what if?.,season_3,19,25,85
candace,out of my way turkey!,season_3,19,25,86
greg lemond,why does everyone think i'm a turkey?,season_3,19,25,87
doofenshmirtz,so perry the platypus. let me tell you my latest scheme. the other day i was browsing the internet when...,season_3,19,27,90
doofenshmirtz,i came to an online auction for a super multi-inator. i wasn't even sure what it did but you know zupermuhltienator was my grandmother's maiden name. it was a sign. i had to have it but then something terrible happened. a pop-up ad kept me from hitting the bid now button. it really hit me where i lived too. you see i always hated advertising ever since the early '80s when i did a little product modeling to finance my first -inator.,season_3,19,28,92
photographer,that's it. hold the wombat a little closer to your face.,season_3,19,29,94
photographer,closer. a little closer.,season_3,19,30,96
doofenshmirtz,i don't want to talk about it. but then i realized i could use pop-up ads to serve all of my evil ends.,season_3,19,31,98
doofenshmirtz,so i come up with a whole slew of products and services i that could advertise and my pop-up-inator would put thousands of pop-up ads virtually everywhere! i'll make millions!,season_3,19,32,100
candace,right on schedule and fully documented.,season_3,19,35,129
doofenshmirtz,the best part is that pop-up ads would never go away. there's a little button that says click here to close pop-up ad. best idea ever.,season_3,19,38,133
female voice,analyzing pile. .... locating load-bearing wire.,season_3,19,39,135

speaker,sweaty men playing games network presents football x-7. theoretical speculative conjecture or not that what we just said with the conjecture thing? football. sometimes called soccer footy association football or the beautiful game. but in 1952 a british theoretical physicist and football enthusiast professor ross eforp hoped to heighten the football experience by creating the most thrilling and challenging version of soccer imaginable which still allowed the players to survive. he called it football x-7. he proposed building an immense gyroscopic gravity-low stadium creating an omnidirectional pitch allowing teams to play in 3 dimensions. after several attempts to build a football x-7 stadium ended in disaster most scientists engineers and defensive mid-fielders agreed that professor ross eforp's ultimate football game could never become a reality. the final blow came when it was discovered that professor ross eforp's name is the same spelled forwards as it was backwards and in the highly-charged anti-palindrome atmosphere in the mid-1950s professor ross eforp was forced into hiding. as for football x-7 is it possible perhaps one day someone some young dreamer with remarkable building and creative skills might just make professor ross eforp's dream come true? no not a chance don't be ridiculous it's impossible.,season_3,21,19,93
phineas,impossible?! the only thing's that is impossible is impossibility. now ferb and i believe we figured out where professor eforp went wrong.,season_3,21,20,95
beckham ,oi. are you actually saying you're gonna build that here?,season_3,21,20,96
phineas,yes. we are gonna do what no one has ever done before. play the biggest baddest onliest game of football x-7 ever! now who's with me?,season_3,21,20,97

doofenshmirtz,oh man 103? seriously if i was a hot tub people would be getting out of me. they'd be all like wow heinz doofenshmirtz is way too hot. we should get out of him. anyway since you're here i taped my rehearsal. i'll just play it for you. it'll be just as good. i shot this yesterday when i was feeling considerably better then.,season_3,21,24,108

eliza,you asked me to teach you how to be proper and sophisticated for jeremy.,season_3,21,29,123
candace,but- but... right. i can do this.,season_3,21,29,124
eliza,good girl. the first lesson for a lady-in-training is about posture. honestly i'm not quite sure why this is but from birth all proper ladies are warned that they must stand and sit completely vertically straight and even the tiniest bend or deviation on one side will lead directly to a life of horror and destitution.,season_3,21,29,125
candace,makes sense.,season_3,21,29,126
candace,i don't get it. what do polite people not have bookshelves in your country?,season_3,21,31,148

phineas,we'll be right back.,season_3,21,34,159

phineas,like there! right there. thank you. so anyway...,season_3,21,39,169
phineas,we were having a great game. ferb as always was in top form. little did i know it would be ferb's last game. late in the second period the other team had kicked the ball out-of-bounds and ferb grabbed it. suddenly from out of nowhere a herd of emu ran onto the field and carried off our assistant coach. ferb simply put the ball down and walked off the field. that was it. ferb hasn't played football since.,season_3,21,40,171
beckham ,i don't blame him poor fellow. it's the emu curse.,season_3,21,40,172
phineas,the emu curse?,season_3,21,40,173
beckham ,it goes like this: if you're holding the ball and a herd of emus carries off your assistant coach then you're cursed to never be on a winning team again.,season_3,21,40,174
phineas,wow. british curses are really specific.,season_3,21,40,175

phineas,we're gonna have to break that curse!,season_3,21,40,177
beckham ,good luck mate.,season_3,21,40,178
beckham ,to break the emu curse a boy wearing a sunday bonnet must sing the note eb above high c in front of the cursed one.,season_3,21,40,179
phineas,eb above high c? whoa! wait a second who's got a piccolo? buford?,season_3,21,40,180
buford,argh! one day somebody's gonna ask me for some obscure musical instrument and it ain't gonna be there. what's gonna happen then? ,season_3,21,40,181
doofenshmirtz,what is that ringing so- is that eb above high c? oh for crying out loud perry the platypus really? really? you're thwarting the ill...? ,season_3,21,42,184

isabella,hot tub?! why on earth would you build a hot tub on this thing?,season_3,26,31,102

phineas,well it's too bad we couldn't get the potatoes for the latkes. but i'd say everything worked out fine. what's perry doing in a pillory?,season_3,26,51,178
ferb,actually those are stocks; a pillory forces the wearer to remain upright exposing them to poking and prodding from passers-by.,season_3,26,51,179
phineas,wow; i'd expect that kind of esoteric knowledge to come from someone a little older 50 or 60. or perhaps a septuagenarian.,season_3,26,51,180

ferb,our dad sells antiques.,season_3,27,1,3
phineas,you know ferb it's strange how we wave our hands when we say goodbye. it seems so arbitrary. why don't people jump up and down or stick out their tongues or slap their thighs?,season_3,27,1,4
phineas,well if by that you mean we should create a whole new form of communication then i couldn't agree more! that was some nice gesturing ferb. do some more!,season_3,27,2,6

major monogram,ah agent p. sorry i'm running a little late this morning. our satellites haven't picked up any inator activity coming from doofenshmirtz but that's no indication that he isn't up to something. we want you to get down there and have a little look-see. good hunting agent p.,season_3,27,6,13
phineas,finally when someone sneezes rather than say gesundheit just play flugelhorn and give him your left shoe. i think we nailed down the non-verbal cues. now let's look at the syntax!,season_3,27,9,17
linda,candace? what's wrong honey?,season_3,27,9,18

candace,um i'm gonna go with no but thank you.,season_3,27,9,25

candace,mom i don't need to relax i need to bust phineas and ferb.,season_3,27,9,27
linda,well listen sweetie you said so yourself they're just plotting right? that gives you plenty of time to go to the mall before they start implementing-guh. ,season_3,27,9,28
candace,yeah that makes a lot of sense! maybe—hey wait a second are you making fun of me?,season_3,27,9,29
linda,maybe just a little. ,season_3,27,9,30
candace,she's right i probably have plenty of time to go to the mall!,season_3,27,9,31
phineas,okay ferb let's start implementing!,season_3,27,10,33

phineas,yeah what do you think?,season_3,27,14,45
isabella,sounds fun! what do you call it?,season_3,27,14,46
phineas,ferb latin! where you take the first letter of every word move it to the end and then you say erb! so ferb becomes erb-ferb and latin becomes atin-lerb! two letter words stay the same like or stays or. all the fun of pig latin and it's safe for vegetarians to use!,season_3,27,14,47
isabella,oh phineas i think your new language is onderful-werb!,season_3,27,14,48
phineas,by jove i think she's got it! but there's also a lot of non-verbal cues! for example if you wanna say okay you reach for the sky!,season_3,27,14,49
buford,yeah! and when you're hungry you crack your knuckles! oh baby that's good...,season_3,27,14,50
phineas,and if you smell something bad you do jazz hands!,season_3,27,14,51
baljeet,stop looking at me i'm not going to do jazz hands! even though you have totally earned it...,season_3,27,14,52

doofenshmirtz,and stop interrupting me! anyway i've done a lot of research for the past... you know few hours... and i and i found that most people will believe anything they read! and i know it's true 'cause you know... i read it online somewhere. so my new weapon to take over the tri-state area is... propaganda!,season_3,27,18,62
norm,propaganda consists of messages that dishonestly attempt to influence the attitude of a community!,season_3,27,18,63
doofenshmirtz,thanks for that mr. norm-it-all. i've installed a switch back here that prints out propaganda leaflets. all i have to do is speak my evil messages into this microphone err let's see... eh slap yourself! push this button and whatever i say comes printed out on a leaflet. it's gonna work! i'm using a very convincing font. it's bold and it has a lot of serifs!,season_3,27,18,64
norm,serifs are semi-structural details that...,season_3,27,18,65
doofenshmirtz,oh for crying out loud norm! listen here's a buck why don't you go get out of here and get a haircut or something!,season_3,27,18,66

bufavulous,yeah?,season_3,31,26,181
baljeetolas,listen here is how it works. by observing the swamp logic tells me that it is too big to go around. and by gathering information about it from isabel i can logically make assessments about the best way to get across. are you following me?,season_3,31,26,182

carl,well i suppose i could just skip to the epilogue sir. hmm. having signed the peace accord the happy wanderers returned to their village as heroes. the rain stopped and candavere kept her date with jeremiad. as they danced she was as happy as a young girl could be. especially as she was now back to normal. but for now all was right with the world and everyone in the village agreed that it was the best midsummer woad-gathering harvest bonfire's eve ever. certainly the first one to have ten thousand monsters. the end. how was that sir?,season_3,31,32,249

baljeet,you are amputating two perfectly good words and stitching them together. they are the frankenstein monsters of grammar.,season_3,33,1,11

candace,well it kind of had this bolty screwy thing going on and this wrapped wire like... oh i know what it looked like but i don't know how to describe it!,season_3,33,1,16
phineas,no problem. we can use the mind machine to enter your subconscious and retrieve your memory of what the gift looked like. you don't mind if we fix candace's problem first do you baljeet?,season_3,33,1,17
baljeet,no i don't where is perry?,season_3,33,1,18

candace,no why?,season_3,34,1,8
phineas,it was his turn to bat and-- ooh! are you still using these ants?,season_3,34,1,9
candace,those aren't my ants! do whatever you want with them. ,season_3,34,1,10
phineas,look ferb. wouldn't it be great to be part of an ant society? they're so efficient and productive. they're like tiny us-es. hey speaking of us where's perry?,season_3,34,1,11
major monogram,sorry agent p. your monitor is on the fritz today...thanks to someone who isn't aware that croquet is an outdoor game.,season_3,34,3,14
carl,again sir there was nothing on the box to indicate--,season_3,34,3,15
major monogram,anyway let's get this show on the road shall we? dr. doofenshmirtz has been collecting some extremely unusual items the last few days. uh some of the odd purchases include—carl where are my inserts?,season_3,34,3,16
carl,oh sorry sir. do that last bit again.,season_3,34,3,17
major monogram,some of the odd purchases include: biomolecular components simply used to make organic computers a giant pilgrim hat and most curious of all a huge pair of food booties used on the end of turkey legs for decoration. you know carl i really like working live it reminds me of my days in the theater group back at...the academy.,season_3,34,3,18
man 1,francis you stink!,season_3,34,5,21
man 2,get off the stage!,season_3,34,5,22
major monogram,anywho dr. doofenshmirtz is up to something sinister. find out what it is and report back. monogram out. carl fade out. stop it carl.,season_3,34,6,24
carl,that wasn't me.,season_3,34,6,25
phineas,ladies and gentlemen gape in awe at the sheer spectacle that is...the antius maximus!,season_3,34,8,28
buford,heh more like the anti-cli-maximus. hehheh yeah?,season_3,34,9,30
baljeet,yes i got it.,season_3,34,9,31
phineas,oh that was just a scale model to get the investors interested. this is the real thing.,season_3,34,9,32
baljeet,woah!,season_3,34,10,34
isabella,how did we miss that?,season_3,34,10,35
phineas,and right over there is ferb's resize-nizer.,season_3,34,10,36
baljeet,what does that do?,season_3,34,10,37
phineas,well you find an anthill and then you add a scoop of it to the pot. then the ant resize-inizer will rain enlarging fluid onto the dirt pile and cause the ants to move towards the large synthostatic light making them bigger. then they continue to the antius maximus the perfect place for the larger ants to live. in no time we should have an ant farm filled with giant ants. or gi-ants.,season_3,34,10,38
isabella,nice one!,season_3,34,10,39
baljeet,oh clever wordsmithing good sir!,season_3,34,10,40
phineas,thank you.,season_3,34,10,41
buford,oh fine. and i just get an eye-roll for anti-climaximus?,season_3,34,10,42
candace,oh what the heck is that thing? oh i'm gonna go tell mom.,season_3,34,11,44
phineas,in order to move amongst the ants without upsetting them we need to douse ourselves in ant pheromones. it's sort of like ant cologne which will make them think that we're one of them. but not too much! we don't want them getting too friendly! ,season_3,34,12,46
buford,bum bum bum...,season_3,34,12,47
baljeet,stop it buford.,season_3,34,12,48
buford,it smells like my grandma's house!,season_3,34,13,50
isabella,why does your grandmother's house smell like ant pheromone?,season_3,34,13,51
buford,have you met my grandma?,season_3,34,13,52
isabella,let's go see what the ants think of our new cologne.,season_3,34,14,54
phineas,you know what i like about our friends? we say things like we're gonna douse you with ant pheromones and they're just like okay whatever. they're so cool!,season_3,34,14,55
doofenshmirtz,ha! perry the platypus?,season_3,34,16,58
doofenshmirtz,there's my guy. why the thanksgiving-themed trap you may ask? you know how you get all and lethargic after you eat thanksgiving dinner? well it's not because you're really full and you know slightly out of shape. it's because of all the tryptophan in the turkey. now imagine if the turkey were say the size of...a car or a building there would be no resisting the tryptophanicle level of nature's little sleeping potion. that—is why—i created: the turkey-inator! wait can you—can you see it from that little door or do i have to move the hat or—you're good? you're good. with this i will fly over the city turning things into turkey all willy nilly then—no one will be able to resist the all of that perfectly cooked turkey goodness. and once the tryptophan cooks in i'll take over the tri-state area with ease! won't that be trypto-fun? heeheehee. you know tryptophan trypto...it's...you know like...i'm wasting all this wordsmithing on a platypus.,season_3,34,17,60
linda,this had better be important...,season_3,34,19,63
candace,mom phineas and ferb are building a huge glass and sand thing in the yard it looks like a giant ant farm but i don't know what it does!,season_3,34,19,64
linda,candace please--,season_3,34,19,65
vivian,hold still linda!,season_3,34,19,66
linda,look candace this is just gonna have to wait until i can take a break.,season_3,34,19,67
candace,but mom they're abusing their liberty! don't you find that ironic?,season_3,34,19,68
linda,not enough to act upon right now dear.,season_3,34,19,69
candace,okay fine.,season_3,34,19,70
doofenshmirtz,so long perry the platypus! next time you see me i will be the indisputable ruler of the tri-state area! and when i say indisputable i mean totally disputable! wait no no that doesn't work i mean...uh-uh-putable! i-i mean puta—no. eh the moment's gone.,season_3,34,20,72
candace,phineas and ferb let me in! oh hello yeah take it easy.,season_3,34,22,75
candace,i-i guess i can stay for a little. ha! no need to crowd okay?!,season_3,34,23,78
phineas,cool!,season_3,34,23,83
phineas,hey i wonder where they're going?,season_3,34,23,88
baljeet,probably to see their queen.,season_3,34,23,89
phineas,good idea! let's go see the queen! wow. candace? you're queen?,season_3,34,23,90
candace,you know you should really fix that doorbell. i must've pressed it like 10 times and all it did was squirt sticky stuff on me.,season_3,34,23,91
phineas,the pheromones! oh that's why the ants think you're their queen! so what's it like to have millions of ants at your beck and call?,season_3,34,23,92
candace,oh it's great. finally someone understands my ideas. only they keep bringing me crumbs and grasshopper legs. i could really go for a salad. ,season_3,34,23,93
phineas,hey i wonder where are they going? ,season_3,34,23,94
candace,hey get back here! what's the point of being queen if you're all alone?! say these bread crumbs aren't bad!,season_3,34,23,95
doofenshmirtz,time to start my turkey takeover! commence random firing! ,season_3,34,25,98
phineas,candace! you've gotta see what the ants are up to! i think you really made an impression on them.,season_3,34,27,101
candace,so what'd they do?,season_3,34,27,102
phineas,well you asked for a salad and a queen dress so first they evolved from a hunter-and-gatherer society to an agrarian society. look they mastered farming in less than 10 minutes.,season_3,34,27,103
baljeet,then they put it all together to make you this salad. there are still grasshopper legs in it but other than that it is not bad.,season_3,34,27,104
phineas,then three minutes ago they had an industrial revolution. check it out! they're weaving the fabrics needed to make a dress for you!,season_3,34,27,105

phineas,but what about exports?,season_3,41,8,47
zengle,well...the canning facilities shut down after the shaft stopped working.,season_3,41,8,48
phineas,the shaft?,season_3,41,8,49
zengle,all of drusselstein runs off of central shaft. or at least...it used to. drusselstein's a long narrow land the only country in the world where a central shaft makes any sense except for maybe chile. at the end of the shaft was an exercise wheel powered by thousands of rabbits. the rabbits turned the wheel the wheel turned the shaft and the shaft turned everything else. a miracle of 16th century science today! it powered our vashing machines our blenders our schwingel presses and of course it ran all of the country's doonkelberry processing plants. the rabbits wouldn't keep up so we decided to upgrade from rabbits to a more powerful source of energy: goats. so we set up a differential on each side of the shaft that the goats might valk upon the ground. but the leftsiders sent their goats walking clockwise and the rightsiders sent their goats walking counterclockwise. so the shaft couldn't turn.,season_3,41,8,50
phineas,but the solution is so obvious!,season_3,41,8,51
isabella,just have one side turn their goats around.,season_3,41,8,52
zengle,yes but we are a proud people. in our culture turning your goats around is the mark of a coward! neither side will back down. so it is such as it has ever been in drusselstein land...of...the shaft! i am done now.,season_3,41,8,53
zengle,uh-oh. time for the 5 o'clock demonstrations.,season_3,41,9,55

brigitte,oh buford you silly boy. i'm a well bread refined european. i would never let the fireside girls know that i was vaguely interested in brute such as you. in fact ,season_3,44,17,122

phineas,oh well we try to build some big project or do something...,season_3,45,1,10
candace,i'm aware of the concept phineas. i was just being sarcastic.,season_3,45,1,11
phineas,really? hey that was pretty good. wow i totally fell for it. ferb i totally fell for it...,season_3,45,1,12
candace,anyway...,season_3,45,1,13
phineas,oh right anyway ferb and i decided that today we're gonna let you pick what we're gonna do today!,season_3,45,1,14
candace,let me get this straight. you are going to allow me to pick what you are gonna build today.,season_3,45,1,15
phineas,that's about the size of it candace.,season_3,45,1,16
candace,size! that's it! it's got to be huge. no wait you built a skyscraper to the moon and who knows where that went. a mom attractor!,season_3,45,1,17
phineas,cool! you mean like a big tractor mother with all its little baby tractors?,season_3,45,1,18
candace,no i mean a mom attractor. a big contraption that will attract mom so that she'll come home and see what you guys built.,season_3,45,1,19
phineas,well you heard the lady. ferb she knows what we're gonna do today.,season_3,45,1,20
candace,how can i help?,season_3,45,1,21
phineas,well we're gonna need a list of things that mom likes.,season_3,45,1,22
candace,oh hey dad! you know mom pretty well.,season_3,45,2,24
lawrence,oh yes. i'd like to think so yes.,season_3,45,2,25
candace,i'm trying to think of things that mom likes.,season_3,45,2,26
lawrence,oh so many things really. music hobbies you kids. ooh! you know what she really likes is my famous rhubarb creme brulee. i used to make it for her all the time when we were dating. oh it made her so happy. candace? well all right then.,season_3,45,2,27
major monogram,ah there you are agent p. well let's get down to brass tacks or whatever it is tacks are made of these days. it seems that dr. doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the polyethylene in town. it's a substance apparently used in disposable baby diapers. it could be an evil scheme or it could just be neutral. get out there and absorb the situation. now since your hovercraft is in the shop carl has had to arrange last minute alternative transportation for you.,season_3,45,4,30
carl,yes. hello agent p. so yeah go ahead and put on that fruit hat.,season_3,45,4,31
lawrence,whoo!,season_3,45,7,35
doofenshmirtz,what is this? some sort of latin gorilla cha-cha gram? hola.,season_3,45,9,40
doofenshmirtz,ay caramba! perry the cha-cha gram? i mean platy... obviously you're perry the platypus.,season_3,45,10,42
doofenshmirtz,and i was... use the door! yeah that was uh hmm not... not uh good. oh well. there that's better! i much prefer you trussed up in my happy jump-inator! which goes with the theme of my new scheme the baby-cry-inator! i know what you're saying. but heinz you've already done a baby-themed evil plot. but this time i've really nailed it. let me explain.,season_3,45,11,44
doofenshmirtz,you remember my goody two-shoes brother roger the mayor? it is a well-known fact that no politician can pass up kissing a baby for fear of alienating the electorate. this can be risky though because if the baby cries you can alienate the electorate even worse than if you refuse to kiss the baby in the first place. this has never really been a problem for roger though everybody loves roger! babies voters dogs cats guys with shovels giant squid you name it. but this little baby and by little baby i mean enormous baby is gonna change all of that! today when my brother is campaigning every time he kisses a baby i will uncork the baby-cry-inator releasing such a wail that the voters will think he is universally hated by babies and therefore untrustworthy. i know it sounds complicated but i've thought this one through. babies cry everyone's unhappy and i somehow take over. it's foolproof!,season_3,45,12,46
phineas,hey candace. check it out.,season_3,45,14,49
candace,oh my mom! that is so cool!,season_3,45,14,50

candace,why does she have one of those?,season_3,45,14,52
ferb,women are a mystery.,season_3,45,14,53

baljeet,that is right! three months of summer vacation and i am losing my edge!,season_3,46,3,12

major monogram,hello agent p sorry about the trees they were leftovers from christmas and we didn't have anywhere else to store 'em. oh and uh also the air-conditioning system is on the fritz so pardon all the frost. all over the tri-state area keys are disappearing. businesses can't open the freeways have ground to a halt citizens are locked out of their homes and i for one would really like to get into the executive washroom. it's got a waterfall you know you wave your hand to the water just sort of-... well it's...it's really cool. stop doofenshmirtz! quickly!,season_3,46,5,23
baljeet,look at this! and this is my brain now!,season_3,46,7,26

baljeet,two point seven-three-two times ten to the twenty-sixth power of particles. but i could not tell you the exact location of any of them because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle.,season_3,46,8,39
phineas,seems like it works.,season_3,46,8,40
doofenshmirtz,perry the platypus? you know you could've waited till i put my pants on that would've...least been polite. and do you know what we do to rude people around here? we put them in a water soluble capsule. ha ha! and there's not enough platypus spit in the world to get you out of it. yeah hop this way let me show you what i've been up to.,season_3,46,10,44
doofenshmirtz,keys keys keys! master keys skeleton keys latch keys skate keys i love keys! and you know take it from me once you've accidentally locked yourself in a milk can full of cockroaches for a couple of hours you'll—you'll develop a real appreciation. but uh collecting keys one at a time takes forever! that's why i've invented: the key-find-inator! or the find-a-key-inator! i -- i haven't quite figured out what i want to call it. cool huh? soon i will be able to open any door in the tri-state area it's -- it's brilliant. uh but my key chain is enormous. and—and it weighs a ton and everyone can hear me coming. what i really need is one key that opens everything! the key to the city! my pompous brother the mayor is always handing it out to some yokel of dubious qualifications. well today it's going to be this yokel of dubious qualifications.,season_3,46,11,46
phineas,wow look at him go.,season_3,46,12,48

phineas,great!,season_3,46,12,52
isabella,picked out a favorite?,season_3,46,12,53
baljeet,i have! you see the greatest impediment to making astronomical observations is our atmosphere. it is like looking through pea soup! so to make our terrestrial telescopes more effective i am going to take all of the earth,season_3,46,12,54
phineas,uh...,season_3,46,12,56
isabella,i don't...um...,season_3,46,12,57
buford,sounds... suffocatey.,season_3,46,12,58
baljeet,aw i will disintegrate that bridge when i come to it.,season_3,46,12,59
isabella,but baljeet if the atmosphere is gone --,season_3,46,12,60
baljeet,and it is so simple! i can use an ion coupling device to attract each atmospheric molecule to the second greatest gravity source which in this case is the moon and after the initial impact...,season_3,46,12,61
isabella,he is so hard-core!,season_3,46,12,62
baljeet,...the particles will bounce up into lunar orbit! blue skies on the moon! imagine that!,season_3,46,12,63
phineas,hey baljeet? can i talk to you for a second?,season_3,46,13,65
baljeet,of course! i will just use small words!,season_3,46,13,66
phineas,so...uh we were hoping we could talk you out of transferring the earth's atmosphere to the moon.,season_3,46,13,67
baljeet,on the eve of my greatest triumph? ,season_3,46,13,68
phineas,well we were just thinking it would be sort of a hollow victory you know with everybody not being able to breathe anymore?,season_3,46,13,69
baljeet,science marches on!,season_3,46,13,70
phineas,okay thanks! brain booster in retrospect...not such a good idea.,season_3,46,13,71
buford,i think brain boy's had enough stimulation for one day. ow! hey that hurts!,season_3,46,13,72

doofenshmirtz,yeah so the uh key to the city ceremony's not starting for a while so uh...we got some...oh you know i-i just realized that i'm...i'm wearing a white lab coat and i'm leaning back against a black tire. that's... i think i might have to go change.,season_3,46,14,77
phineas,maybe we could each get a tool and come at him from four different sides.,season_3,46,15,79
isabella,baljeet is way to smart to fall for a trick like that.,season_3,46,15,80
baljeet,plot all you want i have my eye on you! no one will be able to stop me from stripping away the earth's atmosphere! oh the things i will be able to see!,season_3,46,16,82
phineas recording,he was smart before but now he's like a super genius!,season_3,46,17,84
isabella recording,maybe we should try flattery to win him over.,season_3,46,17,85
buford recording,or how 'bout a bribe?,season_3,46,17,86
phineas recording,i don't think we could offer him anything that would satisfy his super intellect.,season_3,46,17,87
isabella recording,yeah he's so amazingly smart now.,season_3,46,17,88
phineas,all right gang. this is our change to attack the atmospheric device.,season_3,46,18,90
isabella,he's bound to notice that.,season_3,46,18,91
phineas,exactly!,season_3,46,18,92
buford,this is just busy work isn't it?,season_3,46,18,93

rodrigo,excuse me the interrupting dr. doofenshmirtz but he can get out of there fairly easy no?,season_3,48,18,76
doofenshmirtz,well duh the trap only needs to hold him for just enough time for you to get through your evil scheme monologue. at that point your nemesis escapes and the race is on! who will win good or evil? no one can say except of course if you go by recent statistics which it's pretty much good who wins every single time. no matter what. but hey if it was easy everyone would take over the tri-state area right? every single person would be in charge and we'd be forced to i don't know decide the rules together by voting or something.,season_3,48,18,77

vanessa,cool.,season_3,48,35,123
doofenshmirtz,i know huh? these massive propellers will physically dislodge the entire tri-state area from the earth and raise it up into the sky where i will then pilot it around and you know run some errands or something and refuse to return it until they make me their leader. hmm. well that went well.,season_3,48,35,124
rodrigo,extremely well. ,season_3,48,35,125
doofenshmirtz,is this like a robot hug for a job well done?,season_3,48,35,126

young liotta's voice,thanks francis. i owe you big.,season_3,49,7,47
ray liotta,anyway our web monitors tell us that dr. doofenshmirtz has been frequenting websites and blogs dedicated to chickens and chicken-related jokes. we don't know what that means but it's gotta be something fowl. we need you to get out there and take him down a peg! that felt great carl! fighting evil like that i was like zing wow yeah! why did i ever drop out of the academy to become a big hollywood star when i'm needed here?,season_3,49,7,48
carl,well to be fair sir you do get paid more than we do.,season_3,49,7,49

doofenshmirtz,this beautiful device replaces anything it hits with a chicken! how funny will that be? roger gets handed the award and suddenly it's a chicken! ha ha! and not just chicken but the nearest chicken! which when you think about it saves a lot of energy. i mean why pull some chicken from halfway around the world when uh there might be one available right around the cornerrrrrrruh? ah this is much better. anyway like i was saying all i have to do is point this at roger just as they're handing him his award and zap! he goes from prestigious mayor with a major award to just some guy holding a chicken. i mean have you ever seen anyone not laugh at a chicken? chicken laugh! chicken laugh! it's obligatory.,season_3,49,14,75

lawrence,well that's the question isn't it. only one of these can be the true dorcham and westley. and no doubt a wrong choice will trigger a nasty booby trap. boot scrapers were famously vengeful people. this could take every ounce of antiquing knowledge that i possess.,season_3,53,9,98

doofenshmirtz,you know if you were flashing back just now i couldn't see it. i'll bet you're wondering what i'm doing here at the beach... at the clam bake. with an oven. and normally i'd be all about telling you and it's a really cool plan too! it involves my latest invention the peach cobbler-inator.,season_3,60,23,76
doofenshmirtz,but i'm getting way ahead of myself. i have to tell you about yesterday for any of this to make any sense! it all started with an establishing shot at my building.,season_3,60,24,78
doofenshmirtz,huh. perry the platypus should be arriving right about... now!,season_3,60,25,81

doofenshmirtz,hey! but uh i couldn't figure out a way to make them all work together...,season_3,60,28,87
doofenshmirtz,...because i was distracted by a leaky faucet in the kitchen! turns out that was actually the perfect idea. so i ditched the squirrels... you know this isn't really making my evil plan short like i promised. sorry. anyway behold! the a-leaky-faucet-inator. i will disgrace and humiliate roger by dropping one big drop of water and...,season_3,60,29,89
doofenshmirtz,hey where'd you go? oh no! you're getting coffee grounds everywhere! this is so much smoother with perry the platypus. i'm just saying.,season_3,60,30,91

doofenshmirtz,king pretty pretty princess. which now that i think of it is a contradiction in terms but it was the first time i ever won anything. so it's gotten me all obsessed about entering contests. but the only thing i'm good at is baking peach cobbler so i i invented... oh yeah. i told you behold the peach-cobbler-inator. what it does is it makes everyone want peach cobbler more than anything else in the world. so whether it's a chili cook-off or a dancing competition or a quiliting bee or whatever the the judges will be compelled to choose peach cobbler as the winner every time.,season_3,60,53,161
doofenshmirtz,plus it's waterproof it's shockproof it's windproof it's...,season_3,60,54,163

norm,look at all those burbling memory bubbles. tell us all about it dr. d!,season_3,62,13,72
doofenshmirtz,for a time i was happy. it was a short time it was... right... there. it was like five seconds when i was pushing the thing back and forth on the rug. and soon i learned my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. my mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. unfortunately the baby turned out to be a boy and because we were out of material i was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year! drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates.,season_3,62,13,73
 i wanted to gain my mother's affection somehow so i went to the claw machine district in hopes of winning her a gift. fortunately i had with me my allowance which i'd been saving for a whole year,one three-cent coin. i dropped it into a slot then carefully maneuvered the claw toward the beckoning fuzzy grail! odds were against me but then it happened! the miracle! the claw grabbed the stuffed animal; it was mine! then like a knight of yore i gallantly gave the prize to my beloved mother... who immediately turned around and gave it to my brother roger. i was crushed as i watched roger produce a big red marker and write his name on the toy. and then afterwards proceed to do the same to my mother claiming both as his own effectively shutting me out of the family dynamic.,season_3,62,13,74
roger,you know heinz there's more than one way to a mother's heart.,season_3,62,13,75

buford,hey remember how we did that super rollercoaster? how 'bout a super duper rollercoaster?,season_4,3,2,14
baljeet,so you are just adding a duper then?,season_4,3,3,16
buford,it's an acceptable suffix.,season_4,3,3,17
isabella,we did a portal to mars. maybe...a portal to venus?,season_4,3,3,18
baljeet,hah! only if they make spf 12 million.,season_4,3,3,19
buford,okay-okay! how 'bout a super-super duper-duper-duper rollercoaster? what too much or not enough?,season_4,3,3,20
phineas,actually instead of improving one of our old inventions we should make something brand new! something simple.,season_4,3,3,21
isabella,how do you mean?,season_4,3,3,22
phineas,well what is summer all about?,season_4,3,3,23
phineas,yeah we all know the song. but i'm not exactly sure how....,season_4,3,4,26
buford,well hurry up and think of somethin' i'm gettin' tired hanging around here.,season_4,3,5,28

carl,sir it was a typo doof isn't at the shark he's at the park.,season_4,3,7,35

carl,you have a heebie-jeebie scale sir?,season_4,3,8,38

buford,i'll just stay here and fiddle with stuff so i look busy.,season_4,3,10,44
phineas,hey buford.,season_4,3,11,46
buford,what? i didn't take nothing out of nowhere. but uhm just as a hypothetical. uh... what do you think would happen if say you took that goofy doohickey-thing out of the thingamawhatsit?,season_4,3,11,47
phineas,hmm... good question. ferb? well if we account for the coolness of the jet propulsion circuits this early in the day and the increased internal humidity while that access port is open removing the part in question would cause the machine to emit a ray that turns a human into a fly.,season_4,3,11,48
buford,really?,season_4,3,11,49
phineas,you'd be surprised how often removing a single component can make the difference between one thing and a highly complicated totally unrelated other thing. for instance if you remove this part it will become a sorbet machine. why do you ask?,season_4,3,11,50
buford,oh no reason.,season_4,3,11,51
candace,a hair bow? only stacy can pull this off. i'm a fly how is this possible? phineas and ferb you are so buzzzzzzzzted! mom!,season_4,3,11,52

doofenshmirtz,ah perry the platypus won't you join me for a picnic? see? even my trap design has become...lackluster.,season_4,3,15,61
phineas,lady and gentlemen may we present the good old-fashioned new-fashioned tire swing! the fully-pressurized cabin is gyroscopically balanced for a perfectly smooth ride.,season_4,3,17,64
baljeet,hmmm. now it just feels like we are watching a movie.,season_4,3,17,65
phineas,true but we can also go old school! hang on everybody!,season_4,3,17,66
isabella,this is great!,season_4,3,18,68
buford,i have never been so sick to my stomach!!,season_4,3,18,69

isabella,i guess that's it. fun's over.,season_4,3,37,139
phineas,au contraire. sorbet?,season_4,3,37,140
doofenshmirtz,this is great! the best inator i've ever made! and you know what perry the platypus? there's no self-destruct button on this so there's no way you can stop me from taking over the entire tri-state— huh. well like my uncle boris used to say when life's goin' well a giant tire comes along and smashes your inator. we all thought he was crazy at the time but now it seems rather prophetic.,season_4,3,39,143
buford,i don't get why this stuff is called sorbet? ain't it just a fancy people word for ice cream?,season_4,3,41,146
ferb,while ice cream is made from dairy products and turned vigorously with air sorbet is made entirely out of fancy people.,season_4,3,41,147

doofenshmirtz,uh not to burst your bubble but i don't think we're slowing down.,season_4,7,40,163
lyla,we're not i just got the hazard lights working. safety first. the brakes were too far gone to fix. now we just need to get all the passengers and precious albert the moose into the same car and we can save them. you're right! the caboose! let's go!,season_4,7,40,164
doofenshmirtz,this is why i'd rather not make friends they find someone else and bam! you're alone.,season_4,7,40,165
lyla,attention passengers there is no need to panic but--,season_4,7,40,166
butler,pardon the interruption precious albert sir but your tea is ready.,season_4,7,41,168
lyla,folks everything is under control eh? we're going to separate the caboose from the rest of the train. oh you already did it. nice going partner. i'm going to take a pic of this and send it to c.o.w.c.a.,season_4,7,42,170
doofenshmirtz,we're saved. we did it! ,season_4,7,42,171
doofenshmirtz,wait i swear that wasn't me.,season_4,7,43,173
lyla,banister! i should've known. you thinking what i'm thinking?,season_4,7,44,175
doofenshmirtz,aw man i never have a grappling hook when i need one. and i totally looked at mine this morning when i was getting dressed. right there on the dresser. i hate it when that happens.,season_4,7,45,177
bannister,well well well. if it isn't c.o.w.c.a.'s best agent the unfortunately named lyla lolliberry.,season_4,7,46,179
lyla,listen you i come from a long alliterative line of lolliberrys.,season_4,7,46,180
bannister,and now you're trapped miles above solid ground with nothing but a beaver at your side.,season_4,7,46,181
doofenshmirtz,yo bro. back so soon? my evil plan usually takes all day. how'd you do it so fast?,season_4,7,46,182
bannister,well i'll tell you. it went a little something like this: ,season_4,7,46,183
doofenshmirtz,well i guess if you've got no one to monologue to...,season_4,7,46,184
lyla,enough backstory.,season_4,7,46,185
doofenshmirtz,actually that's not uh that's not really a backstory it's just expositional flashback. it doesn't uh have any childhood trauma. it doesn't really form who he is. it's not... it's just flashback there's a difference. it's suble but there's a difference. anyway you're not the only productive one. i've taken care of your moose problem.,season_4,7,46,186
bannister,perfect! no albert the moose. no canada day.,season_4,7,46,187
lyla,and you call yourself a canadian!,season_4,7,46,188
banister,do i? you think that just because i'm polite smell like pine needles and over emphasize me t's i'm canadian? well you'd be wrong! because i'm from greenland! ,season_4,7,46,189
doofenshmirtz,cool flag.,season_4,7,47,191
bannister,thanks. wait! no it's not! and that's the problem! we have no national pride! i mean listen to this: greenland's national anthem. seriously! does that inspire you to do anything other than icefish? but canada? oh they've got it all. the maple syrup. the national parks. the medal winning curling team. and the moose. the moose! the symbol of canada's national pride! precious albert the moose! what if he were to disappear? everyone would lapse into a deep malaise. forgetting what it means to be canadian. i will then annex canada to greenland! bring back precious albert and reinvigorate the national pride! and i've written a new national anthem.,season_4,7,47,192
doofenshmirtz,you're from greenland! do you know how it meant from mis-representing you country of origin to the l.o.v.e.m.u.f.f.i.n. organization? plus your scheme is unnecessary complicated and doesn't even seem like it would work! and that's coming from me!,season_4,7,48,200
banister,it's the perfect plan! yes it will. see he agrees. will you stop it?,season_4,7,48,201
lyla,who is he talking to?,season_4,7,48,202
banister,oh how rude of me allow me to introduce... me-positive and me-negative! they're two magnetic robots i created for the purpose of vanquishing my enemies!,season_4,7,48,203
doofenshmirtz,magnetic robots?,season_4,7,48,204
bannister,yes because it's all about polarity! you can't have two positives or two negatives.,season_4,7,48,205
doofenshmirtz,oh you can have two negatives just look at my family.,season_4,7,48,206
lyla,wait a second. those robot parts look familiar.,season_4,7,48,207
bannister,oh right. i got them from some friends of mine. i think you may have met in seattle. ,season_4,7,48,208
doofenshmirtz,wow those guys have been playing cards really quietly.,season_4,7,48,209
lyla,i remember them. but i knew they would lead me to you banister. that's why i let them escape.,season_4,7,48,210
bannister,never mind them. me-positive and me-negative can take care of you.,season_4,7,48,211
lyla,oh i get it we're going to have an old fashioned helicopter fight.,season_4,7,48,212

banister,what!? farväl!,season_4,7,49,239

doofenshmirtz,well how was he supposed to know you had a tracker on their truck?,season_4,7,52,252
lyla,he understands how these things are. one minute your catching a thief the next you get intel they might be leading you somewhere bigger and better.,season_4,7,52,253
doofenshmirtz,oh and by bigger and better you obviously mean me! right? right?,season_4,7,52,254

lyla,our mission?,season_4,7,53,260
doofenshmirtz,...maybe we could drop by niagara falls. it's so close by and i've always wanted to see it.,season_4,7,53,261
monogram,well i suppose we could swing by on our way back.,season_4,7,53,262
doofenshmirtz,i wonder how my scheme worked out for professor banister. i'm sure that cloud magnitizer-inator was a winner.,season_4,7,54,264
candace,mom! mom! mom! hey perry. mom! mom! mom!,season_4,7,55,266
phineas,how was it that a cloud was able to carry off our metal superstructure?,season_4,7,55,267

major monogram,psst! agent p!,season_4,8,4,5

carl,sir it says non-transferrable right at the bottom!,season_4,8,7,12
major monogram,oh carl they never look at the photo. anyway get out there agent p and good luck! and make sure to stop and smell the roses! well. . . he never stops to smell the roses.,season_4,8,7,13
carl,i know sir.,season_4,8,7,14
buford,in fact it was the ancient tunisians who actually developed many of the techniques still used today.,season_4,8,8,16
phineas,wow buford. i didn't realize the wedgie had such a rich history.,season_4,8,8,17
baljeet,help! phineas and ferb and to a lesser extent buford! i am having an existential emergency! i find myself incapable of making decisions!,season_4,8,8,18
buford,is that a fact? you'd better sit down.,season_4,8,8,19
baljeet,okay. ,season_4,8,8,20
buford,come to think of it maybe your point would be better made standing up.,season_4,8,8,21
baljeet,you are right! ,season_4,8,8,22
baljeet,you are﻿ right. i'd better -- cut it out!,season_4,8,8,24
phineas,how did you get in such a state baljeet?,season_4,8,8,25
baljeet,well i was filling out my early college admission forms and i-,season_4,8,8,26
phineas,whoa baljeet! college is like 9 years away!,season_4,8,8,27
baljeet,i said early. anyway under personal preferences i could not decide whether to select 'loop' or 'string' theory. i was paralyzed with indecision!,season_4,8,8,28
phineas,oh.,season_4,8,8,29
baljeet,right? then i started thinking about how important it is to make the right decision on everything! you see every choice carries with it its own potential timeline. so every decision i make effectively nullifies the possible future! i can't even choose which flavour of ice-cream to order. if i choose vanilla that may set me on the path to the presidency. but if i have strawberry i could get hit by a bus!,season_4,8,8,30
buford,well it's simple then. don't choose the strawberry.,season_4,8,8,31
baljeet,you are missing the point! i would not know that i chose strawberry i would get hit by a bus i am just saying that every decision we make has unforseen repercussions!,season_4,8,8,32
ferb,actually ice-cream sounds pretty good.,season_4,8,8,33
phineas,yeah it does!,season_4,8,8,34
baljeet,if it is okay with you i have prepared a little presentation to illustrate my point. ,season_4,8,8,35
baljeet,march my little off-the-shelf 3-d package robots!,season_4,8,9,47
baljeet,i am sorry everyone. it sounded a lot better in my head.,season_4,8,9,51
buford,exactly what time did you get up this morning?,season_4,8,9,52
phineas,what if you could make both choices? would that make you feel better?,season_4,8,9,53
baljeet,yes! i mean no. i mean yes and no. i mean i do not know!,season_4,8,9,54
phineas,ferb i know what we're-,season_4,8,9,55
buford,wait let me interrupt you! where's perry?,season_4,8,9,56
doofenshmirtz,wow i had no idea that making smoke signals was so complicated! perry the platypus!,season_4,8,10,58

doofenshmirtz,oof! hehe! perry the platypus meet platypus hunter liam mccracken! i found him on an evil consultant website.,season_4,8,10,64

doofenshmirtz,no! you know what? why don't you do the backstory today?,season_4,8,10,66

liam's mother,,season_4,8,10,68
doofenshmirtz,platypuses?,season_4,8,10,70
liam,no no i know it sounds wrong but it's actually right.,season_4,8,10,71
doofenshmirtz,i always thought it was platypi.,season_4,8,10,72
liam,that's also acceptable. they're vile creatures not to be trusted. . . . . . the only mammals with poisonous ankle barbs-,season_4,8,10,73
doofenshmirtz,wait you have a poisonous ankle barb? how come i never knew that?,season_4,8,10,74
liam,well i'm prepared. i've got my own poisonous ankle barbs. and a little somethin' else up my sleeve. i'd like you to meet the ladies. anne nancy tracy 1 tracy 2 troan 41 52 stacy panavise jaharrison...,season_4,8,10,75
doofenshmirtz,in all fairness perry the platypus there was nothing in his profile about you know naming his boomerangs. even i find that a little creepy.,season_4,8,10,76
isabella,hey phineas! whatcha' doin'?,season_4,8,11,78
phineas,you're just in time isabella! in order to help baljeet with his decision-making crisis we've built the infinite probability generator. he'll split into two probability baljeets.,season_4,8,11,79

adyson,i know! we can get stung by radioactive bees and gain bee-themed superpowers!,season_4,12,7,24
holly,um we don't have access to radioactive bees.,season_4,12,7,25
ginger,yeah. that's what's wrong with that plan.,season_4,12,7,26
isabella,but we do have access to phineas and ferb. and they have access to a sorbet machine that turned candace into a fly. they've gotta be able to modify it to turn people into bees.,season_4,12,7,27
katie,phineas and ferb have a sorbet machine that turns people into flies?,season_4,12,7,28

poofenplotz,behold a humble beehive. a massively warded society just like our own. observe a young grub bee fed mass quantities of royal jelly which will make her larger and eventually she will become queen. so logic dictates that if i were to consume massive amounts of royal jelly then i would grow four times bigger and live four times longer and eventually be crowned queen of the world! the queen!,season_4,12,24,66
poofenplotz,and i shall not be dark but beautiful like the night in the day and all shall love me and despair!,season_4,12,25,68

isabella,my bee instincts are buzzing! this must be where our bees went!,season_4,12,29,75

gretchen,let's check it out!,season_4,12,30,80
isabella,woah! it looks like every bee in danville is here! fireside girls forward buzz!,season_4,12,30,81

queen bee,not a clue. and without my jelly i'm way too weak to fly. ugh.,season_4,12,33,89

phineas,well lemme start over. today we're gonna reproduce the gordian knot.,season_4,15,1,9
buford,well why didn't you say so in the first place?,season_4,15,1,10
isabella,i've heard of that but i can't remember the story.,season_4,15,1,11
buford,i got this. back in the day where men wore miniskirts...wiggle wiggle wiggle...wiggle wiggle wiggle...,season_4,15,1,12
buford,...alexander the great was vacationing in gordium when he came upon a celebrated oxcart that was tied to a post using a knot that was so complicated it was impossible to untie. so he just sliced it in half in one bold stroke.,season_4,15,2,14
buford,a simple solution to a complicated problem hence the phrase cutting the gordian knot.,season_4,15,3,16
isabella,i've never heard that phrase!,season_4,15,3,17
baljeet,that is new to me.,season_4,15,3,18
buford,trust me it's a thing.,season_4,15,3,19
phineas,so we'll tie these ropes around our waists and follow this blueprint to recreate it then it's up to us to figure out how to get loose. that'll make us the second people to tie the gordian knot but the first people to untie it!,season_4,15,3,20
baljeet,what if we cannot untie it?,season_4,15,3,21
phineas,no problem. our mom was always really good with knots. there was this one time when candace—,season_4,15,3,22
candace,hey! i thought we weren't going to bring up the clothesline incident ever again!,season_4,15,4,24
phineas,oh right. anyway would you mind getting mom if we get stuck in the ginormous gordian knot we're making?,season_4,15,4,25
candace,when it gets big and weird i'll go get mom.,season_4,15,4,26
phineas,excellent! does everyone have their ropes tied? alright lessee isabella and buford make two loops where you're standing. great! you're good to start climbing. baljeet turn twice counterclockwise and then dive in five loops from the bottom. then ferb and i will do this and this and this and we'll join you inside.,season_4,15,4,27
ferb,shall we?,season_4,15,4,28
phineas,absolutely. let's go bro! baljeet and ferb twist to the right and wiggle towards the top. hey where's perry?,season_4,15,4,29
major monogram,morning agent p! seems that dr. doofenshmirtz has been hitting every all-you-can-eat buffet in town which can't be good! if anything were to happen to doofenshmirtz we would have to make some drastic cuts over here! good luck agent p. oh don't worry about the mess uh carl will take care of it.,season_4,15,6,32

jeremy,oh it's an old mini safe of mine that i found in the back of my closet. i've had it for ages but i haven't used it in so long that i forgot the combination. i thought your brothers could open it. i figured that's a safe bet. heh heh!,season_4,15,9,40
candace,so what's in it?,season_4,15,9,41
jeremy,that's the thing. i don't remember.,season_4,15,9,42
candace,maybe it's a rare baseball card.,season_4,15,9,43
jeremy,no i sold all those a long time ago.,season_4,15,9,44
candace,um could it be your favorite toy car from when you were a kid?,season_4,15,9,45
jeremy,no i traded that for this safe.,season_4,15,9,46
candace,well maybe it's something cute like your baby teeth.,season_4,15,9,47
jeremy,nope. definitely not. i still got those. ,season_4,15,9,48
candace,ew. i mean cute!,season_4,15,9,49
jeremy,yeah the tooth fairy never visited me when i was a kid. anyway...could you give this to your brothers? i gotta rush to work.,season_4,15,9,50
candace,sure. i'll give it to them as soon as they finish their ferbian knot. don't ask.,season_4,15,9,51
jeremy,see ya later alligator!,season_4,15,9,52
candace,in a while crocodile!,season_4,15,9,53
stacy,you guys have got to work on your pet names for each other. so what's in the safe?,season_4,15,10,55
candace,i dunno. but it's not baby teeth.,season_4,15,10,56
phineas,okay everybody. two twists to the left and we should all see daylight.,season_4,15,12,59
isabella,well i just earned my overcoming claustrophobia patch!,season_4,15,12,60
buford,ugh! daylight! ha ha!,season_4,15,12,61
baljeet,now what?,season_4,15,12,62
phineas,now we burrow back in and untie ourselves.,season_4,15,12,63
buford,you gotta be kiddin' me! who looked at this idea and said yeah that'd be fun?! y'see?! this is what happens when we have no intro!,season_4,15,12,64
baljeet,i have been making mental notes of the paths and probabilities as i have gone along. it will be a piece of cake.,season_4,15,12,65
isabella,if i just walk backwards it should work.,season_4,15,13,67
buford,to heck with this game! i'm just gonna chill here for a while. hey!!! who's pullin' on my rope?!,season_4,15,13,68
doofenshmirtz,over here perry the platypus. look. i've already made a commercial for it.,season_4,15,15,71
doofenshmirtz,all you can eat drusselsteinian buffet! it's food the way your mother never made! we've got hassenfloffer entrail waterzooi with gopher gut au gratin! fuzzy fungus flugelbrotchen! and an assortment of tripe-based desserts! and those brave enough can try our new mystery lump! remember doof spelled backwards is food!,season_4,15,17,74
doofenshmirtz,y'know come to think of it it really should be called the all you can stand because drusselsteinian food is terrible! that's the beauty of it. nobody will be able to finish even one plate's worth! my profit margin will be huge! but first i've got to eliminate the competition with this maniacal laughter!,season_4,15,18,76
candace,whadaya suppose it is?,season_4,15,20,79
stacy,it's probably some dumb boy stuff like firecrackers or turtle shells.,season_4,15,20,80
candace,or maybe it's his secret inner thoughts written as a sonnet. no no no no that's not it! i gotta think more like my brothers. y'know use my imagination.,season_4,15,20,81
stacy,this could be dangerous.,season_4,15,20,82
candace,maybe it's a secret spy plan. or a glass eye! or abraham lincoln's beard!,season_4,15,20,83
doofenshmirtz,now just watch what happens when i zap those people over there. ,season_4,15,22,86
man,how can you eat like that and stay so thin?,season_4,15,22,87
doofenshmirtz,oh i built an all-you-can-eat-inator that speeds up your metabolism so you don't gain any weight no matter how much you eat ever.,season_4,15,22,88
man,you should mass produce that machine! everyone would buy one! well you'd be a millionaire!,season_4,15,22,89
doofenshmirtz,pfft don't worry about me making money mister! i've-i've got a complicated plan. i—like i'm gonna take advice from some guy in a diner.,season_4,15,22,90
candace,not...even close! that's it i'm gettin' the boys.,season_4,15,26,118
phineas,looks like we all just got a few more moves to get untied. except for buford who's managed to tie himself into a knot.,season_4,15,30,127
buford,i'm a victim o' circumstance.,season_4,15,30,128

candace,i'm starving! what's that sweet smell?,season_4,15,36,141

doofenshmirtz,hey it looks a lot bigger on the inside than it does on the outside. here have some cozy gumdrop slippers. hehehe. now where was i? oh yeah. i think i know why i'm having a hard time taking over the tri-state area it's because of dinner parties. follow me it goes somewhere. you see my brother roger is a success because of his amazing dinner parties where he dazzles important guests with his magnetic charm. but what if he were unable to charm anyone because his fabulous dinner parties were over before they began!? that's why i created this: the bring-out-the-dessert-inator! you see everyone knows that once the dessert comes out the party's over. t-that's what's called a social cue. this rocket will go into a rogercentric orbit around his house. at the wrong moment it will shoot a blast which will make roger bring out the dessert. ending his dinner party before it can begin. he'll lose his charming edge and people will lose interest in him. bing-bang-boom. they'll stop voting for him and that's when i'll slink in and takeove-- you know i know i'm grasping at straws here and ugh. i'll probably end up grasping a bendy-straw and fall on my face requiring months of rehab to learn how to monologue all over again ,season_4,16,9,67
doofenshmirtz,how about a banana split? ,season_4,16,10,69

newsreader,this week in history! dateline: 1602. the mayors of gimmelshtump and stumblegimp prepare to sign a treaty declaring they are sister cities. however while reaching for his quill the mayor of gimmelshtump accidentally turned 90 degrees. since showing your side to another is considered a stumblegimpian insult the mayor of stumblegimp was forced to follow tradition. and so war was declared. gimmelshtump had no choice but to retaliate. the war escalated and raged on for 50 years. finally the only way to end this senseless feud was for the mayor of gimmelshtump to perform the stumblegimpian humiliating dance of contrition.,season_4,20,8,47
newsreader,and so the mayor of stumblegimp was appeased. and once again all was right between the two cities...or was it? the end!,season_4,20,9,66

doofenshmirtz,it was called night of the felis. i knew right away that the old masters were onto something. imagine taking something cute and enlargening it to frightening proportions. brilliant! but in order to take over the tri-state area i had to study with some other types of small animals preferably something that could fly. and i vowed to get right to work...as soon as the movie was over. the first thing i needed to do was create an inator that would make things larger.,season_4,26,9,45
doofenshmirtz,eh?,season_4,26,9,46
doofenshmirtz,i tried it out on my cowboy hat. it was a success! my ten-gallon hat had turned into a 2000-gallon-hat!,season_4,26,9,47
doofenshmirtz,well that's the end of that hat.,season_4,26,10,49

doofenshmirtz,and i thought the bat was scary before when he was...tiny.,season_4,26,14,67

doofenshmirtz,there we go. now in my never-ending pursuit of domination i discovered that the best evil rulers used fear to keep people in line. so to get into the right headspace i did what any logical evil scientist would do: rented all the scary movies in danville for research. even the lousy ones like dead batteries which is actually better than its prequel batteries that work which was...just a bunch of...portable electronic devices...functioning properly.,season_4,27,15,53
doofenshmirtz,once i was terrified i was able to analyze the fear-based synapses of the brain and extrapolate some wonderful data!,season_4,27,16,55

gordon gutsofanemu,danville is in chaos. summer has become slightly cooler. some sources even go as far as to say brisk. we have word that the mayor is about to address this slight drop in temperature. let's listen.,season_4,32,72,317
roger,citizens of danville i want to assure you that your slight discomfort is of utmost importance to me and i will do everything in my power to...recommend you wear a cardigan or light sweater.,season_4,32,72,318

baljeet,well according to the conditions in the upper atmosphere...,season_4,32,75,327
baljeet ,...we are in for a moderate cold front that shows absolutely no signs of subsiding.,season_4,32,76,329
phineas,that's odd. i can't remember a single danville summer where i needed to wear anything more than a t-shirt.,season_4,32,76,330
isabella,striped.,season_4,32,76,331
phineas,and shorts.,season_4,32,76,332
isabella,blue cargo.,season_4,32,76,333

buford,'splain?,season_4,32,76,335
baljeet,the diameter of the sun can be calculated from the distance between the earth and the sun. since we know the time taken for the earth to go once around the sun p=1 year and the distance traveled by the earth in this process 2πa...,season_4,32,76,336
baljeet,buford!!!,season_4,32,77,338
buford,stop 'splainin'! stop 'splainin'!,season_4,32,77,339
isabella,so that would mean the earth has moved?,season_4,32,77,340
phineas,apparently so.,season_4,32,77,341
isabella,well that would explain why it's noticeably colder.,season_4,32,77,342
phineas,i think we're gonna have to run some more tests.,season_4,32,79,347
doofenshmirtz,now why do we always have to meet in drafty abandoned warehouses? i mean why can't we meet in a drafty abandoned poolside cabana?,season_4,32,80,349
dr. bloodpudding,oh ho ho ho! i'm bananas for cabanas!,season_4,32,80,350
dr. diminutive,right?,season_4,32,80,351
rodney,okay enough of that! gentlemen it's time we pooled our resources! both owca and city hall are in a panic and i believe now is the time to strike! now the last time we confronted those owca agents we barely got out of there with our lives! it's time to play dirty! we'll stealthily capture them one at a time and imprison them here!,season_4,32,80,352

rodney,secondly no one under any circumstances is allowed to say bananas for cabanas.,season_4,32,80,356
dr. bloodpudding,noted.,season_4,32,80,357
rodney,and third which one of you moved the earth away from the sun and changed the weather?,season_4,32,80,358
doofenshmirtz,uh that would be me?,season_4,32,80,359
rodney,doofenshmirtz? you've finally made an inator that actually works?,season_4,32,80,360
doofenshmirtz,hey all of my inators work! it's just that you know i...i don't use them properly. i have poor planning skills. uh i think that's nacho cheese.,season_4,32,80,361
rodney,gentlemen we will now begin our takeover of...the world!,season_4,32,80,362
monty,,season_4,32,80,363
rodney,what was that?,season_4,32,80,364
dr. diminutive,maybe the building's settling.,season_4,32,81,366
rodney,so to you a building settling sounds like someone inhaling sharply?,season_4,32,81,367
dr. diminutive,well i live in a strange building.,season_4,32,81,368
monty,i've got to warn carl.,season_4,32,81,369
rodney,okay tell me you didn't hear that!,season_4,32,81,370

stacy,there's nothing to be afraid of. spiders are harmless. huh!,season_4,32,83,380

rainbow,aw hee haw hee haaaaawwww!,season_4,32,84,383
phineas,alright isabella let me have it one more time.,season_4,32,85,385
isabella,well according to our data this is the relative position of the sun and this is where the earth should be on its orbit this summer. but for some reason we're here. ,season_4,32,86,387
phineas,every test scenario we run comes back with the same results. it just seems impossible. ,season_4,32,86,388
baljeet,aaah! but it is true! the earth has moved away from the sun and now summer is gone!,season_4,32,86,389
buford,big deal! so this summer's over. there's always next summer.,season_4,32,86,390

buford,and that's what would happen if we grew magnets under the earth's core.,season_4,32,91,425
phineas,the credits were a nice touch.,season_4,32,91,426
buford,well there's so many people behind the scenes that deserve a mention.,season_4,32,91,427
phineas,i guess that's another course of action that's off the table. not too many ideas left.,season_4,32,91,428
isabella,but we have to figure out a way to save summer or it'll be gone forever!,season_4,32,91,429
phineas,well baljeet what have you got?,season_4,32,91,430

rodney,thank you for reminding me dr. bringdown.,season_4,32,94,445
villain #4,excuse me i'm dr. bringdown!,season_4,32,94,446

dr. diminutive,his posture's poor.,season_4,32,95,449
doofenshmirtz,nice.,season_4,32,95,450
rodney,come on slouchy! let's make ourselves some demands!,season_4,32,95,451
candace,hey there little fella. you're not such a tough guy are you mr. spider? aw no you're not. no not a bit. ah who ya kidding flynn? to face your fear you gotta at least look. phineas and ferb what did you do to summer?!,season_4,32,96,453

woman #2,you made me buy a blanket with sleeves!,season_4,32,97,456
man #3,my toilet seat's cold.,season_4,32,97,457
doofenshmirtz,ladies and gentlemen of the press kindly put a cork in it. so you've probably figured out that the earth has moved away from the sun.,season_4,32,97,458
rodney,and we at l.o.v.e.m.u.f.f.i.n. are responsible. and now we're here to extort you. and to that end let me introduce you to señor killbot.,season_4,32,97,459
dr. killbot,¿donde esta la biblioteca? ,season_4,32,98,461
rodney,you know in case any of you extortees speak español. we don't want to leave anyone out.,season_4,32,98,462
dr. killbot,¿qué te parece mi bordado? ,season_4,32,98,463
audience,awwww...,season_4,32,98,464
female,aw that's cute.,season_4,32,98,465
doofenshmirtz,and that's our new logo. foreboding yet comforting. so basically if you want us to put the earth back in its proper orbit you have to meet our list of demands. number 1: the minimum height to get on any rollercoaster will now be this high. i mean that high. number 2: pretzels.,season_4,32,98,466
rodney,really? that's how you give demands?,season_4,32,98,467
doofenshmirtz,what? what was wrong with that? i was gonna go for one of those big tubs from lotsmo.,season_4,32,98,468
rodney,you sounded like a bashful santa claus pitching softballs to a girl in a bikini.,season_4,32,98,469
doofenshmirtz,alright number four... wait you don't know what that sounds like!,season_4,32,98,470
rodney,stand aside. listen you dogs with one small inator...,season_4,32,98,471
doofenshmirtz,my inator!,season_4,32,98,472
rodney,...we've moved the earth into an early autumn. now we the collective scientific genius of l.o.v.e.m.u.f.f.i.n. have created an inizer ten times the size and strength! capable of moving the earth so far away from the sun we'll bring about a new ice age! so if you value your puny lives you will meet all the demands on our list or pay the consequences!,season_4,32,98,473
doofenshmirtz,is it just me or is this getting out of hand?,season_4,32,98,474
dr. killbot,quiera lucha tu casa. ,season_4,32,98,475
candace,seriously? someone moved the earth and it wasn't you?,season_4,32,100,479
phineas,not this time no.,season_4,32,100,480
candace,any chance it could spontaneously go back to the way it was?,season_4,32,100,481
phineas,we can't take that chance candace. we'll never have another summer if our plan doesn't work.,season_4,32,100,482
candace,plan? what plan?,season_4,32,100,483
phineas,we're building this massive rocket engine to put on top of mount danville.,season_4,32,100,484
candace,one measly rocket on one mountain isn't going to move the earth phineas.,season_4,32,100,485
phineas,that's why we enlisted the help of other kids around the world. see? there's floria and abdul on mount kilimanjaro ganesh and kabul on mt. everest vsevolod and vanko at the top of mount elbrus and lupert and eporwold on mount haggenhuge. eporwold's the goat. while they finish fine-tuning we'll move our rocket up to mount danville.,season_4,32,100,486
candace,then everyone turns them on and the earth goes back to the way it was?,season_4,32,100,487
phineas,sort of. but the burners all need to be synchronized through this control panel. otherwise we risk ripping the earth's crust apart. do you think you could stay here and help control the thrust?,season_4,32,100,488
candace,these look like simple level controls.,season_4,32,100,489
phineas,yeah. pretty much the same as a sound mixer except this one controls five megarockets capable of ripping the earth in half.,season_4,32,100,490
candace,why can't irving do it?,season_4,32,100,491

doofenshmirtz,it was my idea! that does it! i'm going down there!,season_4,35,28,113
phineas,the big difference is that the marionette has strings while a puppet is hollow so it can be manipulated from within. but that doesn't mean that a marionette can't be hollow or a puppet has strings. the thing to remember is that some people take the subject very seriously even though technically there's no difference grammatically. i looked it up.,season_4,35,29,115
doofenshmirtz,platypus. i was trying to say platypus.,season_4,35,30,117

doofenshmirtz,back in 1805 danville actually elected a warthog as mayor. the public was fed up with the previous administration and thought hey what's the worst that could happen? nepotism that's what. he filled the cabinet with his uncles and brothers and distant cousins and all of city hall was full of swine. except for one chair that they kept empty so y'know it wouldn't be...,season_4,37,23,67

roger,our next category...,season_4,37,48,177

candace,look if you're going to destroy my chance at stardom i think i deserve an explanation.,season_4,37,49,183
mr. random,all right. i i do like the sound of my own voice. so for years now i've wanted to find the elusive klimpaloon. and finally after countless hours web surfing i found shackleberg's journal at an online auction site only to lose the first volume to you two! i did manage to get his second journal but it only contains the last page of the map the map that you have in volume one. so i concocted a long convoluted plan to get you to lead me right to him. huh? hmm. yeah.,season_4,37,49,184
phineas,but why?,season_4,37,49,185
mr. random,you see sales have gone flat. you can only reinvent the bikini and board shorts so many times. but if i could convince the world to start wearing old-timey bathing suits again that's revolutionary! but to do that i was gonna need a gimmick.,season_4,37,49,186
klimpaloon,nang nang nang nang nang... ,season_4,37,50,188
all,,season_4,37,50,189
mr. random,what a combo! he's self-propelled he's got a weird disturbing face on his chest and he makes unintelligible noises. seriously just th-the whole package is irresistible! and he's all mine! he's all mine! ,season_4,37,50,190
phineas,you can't own him!,season_4,37,50,191
isabella,he's a living thing!,season_4,37,50,192
buford,he belongs to the ages!,season_4,37,50,193

phineas,we can't let him unravel klimpaloon's secrets!,season_4,37,50,195

buford,wow! what is with all the negativity?,season_4,37,50,199
candace,enough already! time is running out and i am not going to blow my big break! let's look around. maybe we can find some clues.,season_4,37,50,200
buford,see? now that's constructive.,season_4,37,50,201

candace,follow that thread!,season_4,37,50,203
baljeet,we cannot follow a thread.,season_4,37,50,204

phineas,let's go!,season_4,37,51,208
baljeet,is no one going to talk about where we got the snowboards?,season_4,37,52,210

phineas,that must be mr. random's fortress! follow me!,season_4,37,55,221
candace,now what?,season_4,37,56,223
phineas,okay. i'll just create a diversion here so that buford and baljeet can flank them from the left. ferb can then use his intimidating shout to scatter them so that isabella can come in from behind. that should work unless they have reinforcements. what do you think baljeet? can you give me a number crunch real quick?,season_4,37,56,224
baljeet,uh gimme a sec. i am coming up with a 32.3% chance of success.,season_4,37,56,225

mr. random,look i'm givin' old-timey here a new twist! flashback to fashion forward! it's a little high-concept but take a look!,season_4,37,61,248

mr. random,anyhoo now that i have the original i can figure out what makes him tick. which brings us back obviously to the incredibly threatening machine. so it's time to extract klimpaloon's life force and uh then of course infuse it into my latest swimwear line.,season_4,37,63,261
phineas,we have to do something!,season_4,37,63,262

lindana,and why are you all in parkas?,season_4,37,78,318

nana's friend,yes. you can tell someone how much they meant to you without worrying about getting interrupted. or losing your nerve.,season_4,38,1,5
nana shapiro,or hiccuping. that was my problem. when i was young i had a crush on a certain boy and i wrote a letter telling him how i truly felt. that boy ended up being your grandfather.,season_4,38,1,6

major monogram,agent p it seems that doofenshmirtz is into astrology now and that makes him very dangerous to us. i know what you're thinking. i was like you. i always thought horoscopes were a bunch of hooey. but then i read my own horoscope. i'm a sagittarius. it said it's a bad to get a haircut. how spooky is that? i had my haircut yesterday. today would be a bad day to get a haircut. how do they know that stuff? if doof figured out the astrological science of our agents he could predict our every move!,season_4,38,5,37

doofenshmirtz,ha ha! betcha never dreamt you'd get caught in a dream catcher. actually norm made that this morning. who knew he was so crafty? anyway my astrologer believes that when mercury is in retrograde anything can go wrong and usually does. and you know she's always right she has dark hair and bangs and you know as it turns out mercury has been in retrograde all summer. no wonder my evil schemes keep failing! and that is why i invented the unretrograde-inator! you know to reverse my bad luck. and i know that unretrograde is sort of a double negative. it sounds like i'm making mercury go forwards but i'm actually sending it backwards from going backwards which happens to look forward but it isn't. you know what? basically it's a reverse-inator but... unretrograde-inator! it sounded more astrology-y. look. you know i'll just show you how it works. oh norm! could you come over here for a moment?,season_4,38,12,60

phineas,i know right? luckily ferb has been working on a special z-ray machine that can see through any substance on the periodic table. it's highly experimental so you might want to encase yourself in this lead body armor.,season_4,41,23,41

buford,i do! you see for generations and generations the van stomm family has been the guardian of the secret knowledge and protectors of the mystery capsule. we made the thirteenth-century templars look like a bunch of wusses. and throughout the ages our family has pledged our lives to conceal it from the unenlightened. and in doing so we were entrusted with the only key that can unlock the capsule secrets.,season_4,41,29,57

charlene-2,naive child let me explain.,season_4,44,42,267
candace-2,okay i get it you're still married. but why would you send the ants to the picnic? you had to know we'd come after you.,season_4,44,43,303
charlene-2,of course. and i also knew you would use heinz to get in the building bringing my husband back to me and getting you here so i could get the drop on you.,season_4,44,43,304
candace-2,a lot of convoluted reasons there too.,season_4,44,43,305

phineas-2,sorry we had to fool you like that candace but we needed you to be convincing.,season_4,44,45,330
candace-2,but why?,season_4,44,45,331
phineas-2,ferb figured that if doof and charlene thought that they had the leader of the resistance and the platyborg under lock and key they would devote all their attention to the frontal attack. that way we could come up from behind and—,season_4,44,45,332

dr. baljeet,all we have to do is get these magnetic deprogramming chips near the cyborgs' frontal lobes and they will no longer be evil.,season_4,44,52,351
isabella-2,how do we do that?,season_4,44,52,352
buford-2,look we sewed 'em into these little hats.,season_4,44,52,353

charlene-2,oh i think i'll go with that second thing you mentioned.,season_4,44,60,375
charlene-2,end of the line kid! what a shame! i'll make ya an offer. i could get rid of you right now or you could join me. you could be the leader of my cyborg army.,season_4,44,62,378

doofenshmirtz,sweetie pie i'm back! sorry it took me so long. who would've thought being tri-governor would be so involved?,season_4,47,85,433
vanessa,dad i got an internship at owca so i have to move out.,season_4,47,85,434
doofenshmirtz,what?! but that's the opposite of what i— they're the good guys! i thought for sure now that when i was tri-state governor that we'd be okay!,season_4,47,85,435
vanessa,dad you're totally missing the point. you spend all of your time working on your ridiculous inators and i can't—,season_4,47,85,436
doofenshmirtz,okay first of all they're not ridiculous. convoluted and ultimately pointless maybe.,season_4,47,85,437
vanessa,oh come on dad you build them just to exact petty revenge trying to prove you're evil.,season_4,47,85,438
doofenshmirtz,what? i'm evil. i-i am evil!,season_4,47,85,439
vanessa,no dad. you're basically a nice guy who's pretending to be evil. and you know it seems like it's all out of obligation to your backstories not something that truly comes from your heart.,season_4,47,85,440
doofenshmirtz,wow. so it it's... it's really not about all the success-loser thing?,season_4,47,85,441
vanessa,dad look this owca internship is something i really wanna do. and i don't think this lifestyle choice is making you happy either. is it?,season_4,47,85,442
doofenshmirtz,wow again.,season_4,47,86,444
vanessa,look all i'm saying is try something different.,season_4,47,86,445
doofenshmirtz,like a...like a new inator?,season_4,47,86,446
vanessa,no like try to be a good guy.,season_4,47,86,447
doofenshmirtz,a good guy? me? i can be... well i guess i could. i-i could be a do-gooder doing good just for the sake of... doing good or er what exactly do good guys do?,season_4,47,86,448
vanessa,well they—,season_4,47,86,449
doofenshmirtz,eh it doesn't matter. anyway i get it. i understand now. there's just one thing i gotta do before the whole thing starts over ag—,season_4,47,86,450
candace's alarm,—know what we're gonna—,season_4,47,88,453
candace,ah. oh man! i gotta start all over again!,season_4,47,89,455
doofenshmirtz,ah man! i looped too soon and i didn't have time to be good! ,season_4,47,90,457
norm,wakey wakey!,season_4,47,90,458
doofenshmirtz,norm stuff your cake!,season_4,47,90,459
norm,stuffing it sir! ,season_4,47,90,460
vanessa,hey dad do you have a minute?,season_4,47,90,461
doofenshmirtz,vanessa! yes yes i know you you'd like to move in with your mother and you want to intern at owca and my being evil creates a conflict.,season_4,47,90,462
vanessa,um yeah. how did you know—,season_4,47,90,463
doofenshmirtz,let's just leave it at i know and i vow to be good from now on so your worries are over.,season_4,47,90,464
vanessa,wow you're kind of freaking me out.,season_4,47,90,465
doofenshmirtz,yes yes i'd be obnoxious if i wasn't so charming. anyway i have one more inator to complete and i've got to do it fast so i could really use your help.,season_4,47,90,466
vanessa,what's the inator?,season_4,47,90,467
doofenshmirtz,the time-straighten-out-inator! it straightens out time and keeps it from looping.,season_4,47,90,468
vanessa,i think i'm looping.,season_4,47,90,469
doofenshmirtz,exactly!,season_4,47,90,470
baljeet,i am coming!,season_4,47,91,472
candace,morning baljeet. got to get an early start today. you kids chat i'll get the thingy.,season_4,47,92,474
baljeet,um who is that girl in the bathrobe?,season_4,47,92,475
buford,i was so asleep.,season_4,47,92,476
isabella,she made us come over here.,season_4,47,92,477
baljeet,yes but who is she?,season_4,47,92,478
candace,got it! here dr. genius boy! take this and check out the space-time continuum.,season_4,47,93,480
baljeet,i do not know what that will prove. the space-time continuum is remarkably stable and—oh my goodness!,season_4,47,93,481
candace,blah blah blah blah blah you could disappear forever and so could every memory of your existence. so here's the part you need to pay attention to! are you listening?,season_4,47,93,482
baljeet,i am totally listening!,season_4,47,93,483
buford,i am so not listenin'.,season_4,47,93,484
isabella,me neither.,season_4,47,93,485
candace,i have two brothers and you guys are all best friends. but now they're gone and nobody remembers them because of the space-time continuum thingy. now this is the part of the conversation where you tell me how you're gonna get my brothers back.,season_4,47,93,486
baljeet,well they must have disappeared through a temporal rift. if we could calculate the location of the next rift we could just throw in a rope with a life preserver tied to the end of it and pull it out.,season_4,47,93,487
candace,oh really? a little donut-shaped pool toy is gonna save the universe?,season_4,47,93,488
buford,ya had me at donuts lost me with everything else.,season_4,47,93,489
vanessa,so what you're saying is the days are repeating and you're the only one that notices.,season_4,47,94,491
doofenshmirtz,well maybe that little friend of yours too 'cause she was inside the bubble.,season_4,47,94,492
vanessa,what?,season_4,47,94,493
doofenshmirtz,not important. check it out. perry the platypus should be coming in three two one.,season_4,47,94,494
doofenshmirtz,perry the platypus! your eyes say no! but your hands say yes!,season_4,47,94,496
baljeet,isabella what is the resonance reading on the top meter?,season_4,47,95,498
isabella,forty-two point one six!,season_4,47,95,499
baljeet,candace what is the cosine of eighty-one point seven?,season_4,47,95,500
candace,lessee. seventeen.,season_4,47,95,501
baljeet,buford did the light just change from green to red?,season_4,47,95,502
buford,why should i tell you?,season_4,47,96,504
baljeet,okay. ,season_4,47,96,505
candace,wow. crazy how it sucked up that groundhog huh?,season_4,47,96,506
buford,the what?,season_4,47,96,507
phineas,if things from danville pass into this dimension when a rift opens maybe the door swings both ways. if we can calculate the rift openings then we can get back to our danville. heads up ferb! incoming!,season_4,47,97,509
phineas,huh. groundhogs.,season_4,47,98,511
ferb,i hope that doesn't mean six more weeks of nullville.,season_4,47,98,512
phineas,ahhhhh!,season_4,47,98,513
candace,talk to me baljeet!,season_4,47,99,515
baljeet,by my new calculations the next rift should appear right over...there!,season_4,47,99,516
isabella,quick! throw the life preserver!,season_4,47,100,518
candace,phineas! ferb! if you can hear me grab the life preserver and we'll pull you back!,season_4,47,101,520
buford,what's a life preserver?,season_4,47,101,521
isabella,i have no idea.,season_4,47,101,522
candace,you guys are just gonna have to trust me on this!,season_4,47,101,523
all,whoooooooa!!!!,season_4,47,102,525
doofenshmirtz,who'd have though we'd be such a good team? my daughter my nemesis and my hot beverage. hmm. counter-clockwise on that jib bolt perry the platypus. okay stop. perfect it's done. the days won't loop anymore and i'll have my daughter back! my life will be on a new path and the world will be saved thanks to brand new good guy heinz doofen—,season_4,47,104,529

phineas,hi guys! so good to see you!,season_4,47,107,536
isabella,,season_4,47,107,537
isabella,hey phineas.,season_4,47,109,540
baljeet,spoon!,season_4,47,109,541
baljeet,oh how i have missed spoons!,season_4,47,110,543
buford,orange! eh...not really gettin' a big rush of emotions over this.,season_4,47,110,544
candace,and here are the capri pants.,season_4,47,110,545
isabella,how can you tell they're capri pants? maybe they're just regular pants for someone with shorter legs.,season_4,47,110,546
candace,the important thing is—,season_4,47,110,547
buford,hey!,season_4,47,110,548
candace,—my brothers are here and they're safe! i'm so glad you guys are all right!,season_4,47,110,549
phineas,thanks candace! it's great to see you too!,season_4,47,110,550
candace,wow i guess now that we're gone too mom and dad don't even remember having children. their lives must be so empty.,season_4,47,110,551
isabella,everything here is so gray and lifeless.,season_4,47,114,557
baljeet,this place must exist outside the flow of time. candace you were the only one of us outside the loop. were the looping intervals decreasing in chronological amplitude?,season_4,47,114,558
candace,no they were um... wait what does that mean exactly?,season_4,47,114,559
baljeet,were the days getting shorter?,season_4,47,114,560
candace,yes the days kept getting shorter and shorter.,season_4,47,114,561
baljeet,the time pocket is dissolving!,season_4,47,114,562
buford,and where does that rate on the... good-bad scale?,season_4,47,114,563
baljeet,buford when the time pocket ceases to exist so will we!,season_4,47,114,564
isabella,see what i mean? one woman's capri pants is another's... what'd i miss?,season_4,47,115,566
doofenshmirtz,vanessa!,season_4,47,117,569
vanessa,dad i have to talk to you—,season_4,47,117,570
doofenshmirtz,help me build my inator! hurry! quick!,season_4,47,117,571
vanessa,what're we doing?,season_4,47,117,572
doofenshmirtz,building a time-straighten-out-inator.,season_4,47,117,573
vanessa,dad we really need to talk!,season_4,47,117,574
doofenshmirtz,there you are! perry the platypus grab a screwdriver and help us!,season_4,47,118,576
baljeet,okay this paper towel represents the space-time continuum. normally it moves in a straight line and pretty soon you do not have anything left. what i cannot seem to figure out is what could have possibly caused the space-time disruption in the first place? and an even bigger conundrum is how candace is standing outside of the space-time interruption and somehow knew about its effects.,season_4,47,119,579
candace,yeah that's a puzzler. but you know that old saying: never question the source of a...temporal time...space...loop thingy. heh heh. eh.,season_4,47,120,581
phineas,really?,season_4,47,120,582
buford,yeah i've heard that.,season_4,47,120,583
baljeet,well we have to build something to close the hole and stop the looping. but it will require einsteinium tungsten wire and micro-crystal plasma resistors.,season_4,47,120,584
phineas,well stuff keeps getting sucked into this place. maybe we can find a hi-tech machine or some lab equipment that uses all of that stuff.,season_4,47,120,585
buford,what about this machine right here?,season_4,47,120,586
phineas,wow. strange that we didn't notice that.,season_4,47,120,587
phineas,einsteinium tungsten wire plasma resistors! wow this is awesome!,season_4,47,121,589
candace,don't touch that thing! that's the machine that started all of...this...so...um...yeah...you gotta be careful with that thing.,season_4,47,121,590
baljeet,and you know this how?,season_4,47,121,591
candace,when i was at vanessa's i may have accidentally intentionally pushed the button.,season_4,47,121,592
all but ferb,,season_4,47,121,593
candace,okay i was having a rotten day. one crummy thing after another kept happening and when he told me that this thing can make the day start over again i just couldn't help myself. and then the days just kept looping and i know i should've said something sooner but i kept coming closer to busting you guys! and i swear i had no idea it would do any of this. i thought i'd get one do-over and that would be that but then i saw it was creating problems and making things disappear and making people forget but by the time i tried to stop it it was too late and i lost you guys! and i don't know how to fix it!,season_4,47,121,594
buford,well if this thing's the problem maybe we should press this big self-destruct button.,season_4,47,121,595
baljeet,nooooo! if time stops looping there will be no big tears in the fabric of space-time and no way for us to get home. we must find a way to get ourselves and that machine through one of the rifts and back into danville. then we can push the button and blow up the machine.,season_4,47,121,596
buford,i call pressing the button!,season_4,47,121,597
phineas,come on gang! we know what we have to do today!,season_4,47,121,598
buford,yeah. ruuuuuuunn!!! ,season_4,47,122,600
phineas,well it's not pretty but we did it.,season_4,47,124,624
buford,i dub thee the buford van stomm time catapult. i won the naming rights fair and square.,season_4,47,124,625
phineas,c'mon guys! no time to lose! how's it lookin' baljeet?,season_4,47,124,626
baljeet,it looks like the next anomaly will appear any second now. i am working on the exact coordinates but there is significant interference. it looks like there may be multiple rifts coming.,season_4,47,124,627
phineas,as long as we can hit one of 'em. stand by your hand cranks people!,season_4,47,124,628
baljeet,here they come!,season_4,47,124,629
phineas,it's cars! baljeet what are those coordinates?!,season_4,47,125,631
baljeet,got them! 34 degrees 10 minutes 15 seconds north. 15 minutes zero seconds west.,season_4,47,125,632
phineas,launch now!,season_4,47,125,633
candace,where is the tear?! where is the tear?!,season_4,47,126,635
baljeet,any second!,season_4,47,126,636
the gang,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!,season_4,47,127,638
doofenshmirtz,how're ya doin' back there perry the platypus?,season_4,47,130,643
doofenshmirtz,takes care of that. let's plug this baby in and get her goin'!,season_4,47,131,645
vanessa,are you sure it'll work?,season_4,47,131,646
doofenshmirtz,oh yeah absolutely. there's a guaranteed 55% chance of success so we're...we're good to go.,season_4,47,131,647
vanessa,wait so there's still a 45% chance that it won't do anything?,season_4,47,131,648
doofenshmirtz,of course not it's not gonna do nothing. there's also a 45% chance it'll destroy everything in existence.,season_4,47,131,649
vanessa,what?! dad you have to tell us things like this!,season_4,47,131,650
phineas,is everyone okay?,season_4,47,132,652
buford,aw my muffins got smashed.,season_4,47,132,653
candace,come on! no time to lose! literally!,season_4,47,132,654
phineas,okay baljeet just to confirm destroying the machine will put the space-time continuum back to normal.,season_4,47,133,656
baljeet,yes. and we need to do it quickly. the time loops are accelerating exponentially and—,season_4,47,133,657
doofenshmirtz,oh. we're starting here now. hey it has been brought to my attention that i should tell you guys there's a 55% chance this will work but a 45% chance that it'll destroy reality as we know it.,season_4,47,135,660
vanessa,what?!,season_4,47,135,661
doofenshmirtz,absolute worst-case scenario.,season_4,47,135,662
vanessa,okay what happens if we don't push it?,season_4,47,135,663
doofenshmirtz,if we do nothing there's a hundred percent chance that the time pocket will dissolve and it'll destroy every— y'know there's a whole illustration i can do with a paper towel and a hook but i don't have time.,season_4,47,135,664
vanessa,okay we have to take a moment and think about the—,season_4,47,135,665
buford,oh man! that was quick!,season_4,47,137,668
phineas,the days must be compressing to this exact point!,season_4,47,137,669
candace,no time to lose! move! move! move!,season_4,47,137,670
phineas,hurry guys!,season_4,47,138,672
doofenshmirtz,okay here's the odds. save the day: 55%. destroy the universe as we know it: 45%. but do nothing at all: a hundred percent chance of the end of time. so whadaya say?,season_4,47,140,675
vanessa,whoa.,season_4,47,140,676
doofenshmirtz,good answer! how 'bout you perry the platypus? come on if you got something to say now's the time.,season_4,47,140,677
phineas,the time loop is getting too short!,season_4,47,143,681
buford,what if i throw baljeet?,season_4,47,143,682
baljeet,you are just using this as an excuse!,season_4,47,143,683
doofenshmirtz,okay i gotta tell ya there's a lot of risk involved but we've discussed it over like three loops already and i think this is our only option. are you with me?,season_4,47,145,686
vanessa,yeah i am.,season_4,47,145,687
perry,,season_4,47,146,689
doofenshmirtz,okay i should have just about enough time to press this button if i'm not too overly dramatic about it.,season_4,47,146,690
phineas,we can't reach it! there's just not enough time!,season_4,47,147,692
baljeet,d-did it work?,season_4,47,148,694
